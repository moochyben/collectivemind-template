# Operations Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to the operational aspects of the project, including monitoring, maintenance, troubleshooting, and support procedures.

## Purpose

Operations documentation serves to:

1. **Guide Operations**: Provide instructions for day-to-day operations
2. **Support Monitoring**: Document monitoring strategies and alert responses
3. **Enable Maintenance**: Outline maintenance procedures and schedules
4. **Facilitate Troubleshooting**: Provide guidance for diagnosing and resolving issues
5. **Ensure Reliability**: Document high availability and reliability strategies
6. **Support Scaling**: Guide operational aspects of scaling the application

## Document Types

This directory includes several types of operations documentation:

- **Operational Overview**: High-level description of operational architecture and responsibilities
- **Monitoring Setup**: Configuration of monitoring tools, dashboards, and alerts
- **Runbooks**: Step-by-step procedures for common operational tasks
- **Incident Response**: Procedures for responding to operational incidents
- **Maintenance Procedures**: Scheduled maintenance tasks and procedures
- **Backup and Recovery**: Backup strategies, schedules, and recovery procedures
- **Capacity Planning**: Guidelines for resource planning and scaling
- **Performance Optimization**: Strategies for optimizing system performance
- **Troubleshooting Guides**: Procedures for diagnosing and resolving common issues
- **Support Procedures**: Guidelines for providing user support and escalation paths

## Document Structure

Each operations document should follow this general structure:

1. **Purpose**: What the document aims to achieve
2. **Scope**: What systems, components, or processes are covered
3. **Prerequisites**: Required access, tools, or knowledge
4. **Detailed Procedures**: Step-by-step instructions
5. **Verification**: How to verify successful completion
6. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and their solutions
7. **References**: Links to related documentation or resources

## Naming Convention

Operations documentation should follow this naming convention:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-operations-topic-name.md
```

For example: `YYYY-MM-DD-monitoring-setup.md` or `YYYY-MM-DD-backup-procedures.md`

## Best Practices

When creating operations documentation:

1. Focus on practical, actionable procedures
2. Include clear decision trees for troubleshooting
3. Document alert thresholds and response procedures
4. Include verification steps for all procedures
5. Document dependencies between systems and components
6. Include contact information for responsible teams
7. Document escalation paths for critical issues
8. Keep procedures up to date with system changes
9. Include examples and screenshots where helpful
10. Document both routine and emergency procedures

## Review Schedule

To ensure operations documentation stays current:

- Monitoring setup: Review monthly or when monitoring changes
- Runbooks: Update quarterly or when procedures change
- Maintenance procedures: Review quarterly or when systems change
- Troubleshooting guides: Update when new issues are identified
- Backup procedures: Test and update quarterly
