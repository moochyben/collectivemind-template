# Process Documentation

This directory contains process documentation for the project. These documents outline the development processes, workflows, and best practices for the team.

## Purpose

Process documentation serves to:

1. **Standardize Workflows**: Establish consistent development and operational processes
2. **Onboard Team Members**: Help new team members understand how work is done
3. **Ensure Quality**: Define quality standards and review processes
4. **Improve Efficiency**: Document efficient workflows and best practices
5. **Support Compliance**: Ensure adherence to regulatory and security requirements

## Document Types

This directory includes several types of process documentation:

- **Development Workflow**: Git workflow, branching strategy, and code review process
- **Release Process**: Steps for releasing new versions of the product
- **Coding Standards**: Code style guides and best practices
- **Testing Guidelines**: Approaches to unit, integration, and end-to-end testing
- **Security Protocols**: Security requirements and review processes
- **Incident Response**: Procedures for handling production incidents
- **Meeting Rituals**: Structure and cadence of team meetings
- **Decision Records**: Documentation of key technical and product decisions

## Document Structure

Each process document should follow this general structure:

1. **Purpose**: What the process aims to achieve
2. **Scope**: What activities are covered by the process
3. **Roles and Responsibilities**: Who is involved and what they do
4. **Process Steps**: Detailed steps in the process
5. **Tools and Resources**: Tools used in the process
6. **Metrics**: How the effectiveness of the process is measured
7. **Exceptions**: When the process may be bypassed or modified
8. **Related Processes**: Links to related process documentation

## Naming Convention

Process documentation should follow this naming convention:

```
process-name.md
```

For example: `git-workflow.md` or `release-process.md`

## Available Process Documents

| Process | Document | Last Updated |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Git Workflow | [git-workflow.md](./git-workflow.md) | [Date] |
| Release Process | [release-process.md](./release-process.md) | [Date] |
| Code Review | [code-review-process.md](./code-review-process.md) | [Date] |
| Testing Strategy | [testing-strategy.md](./testing-strategy.md) | [Date] |

## Continuous Improvement

Process documentation should be treated as living documents that evolve over time:

- Regularly review and update processes based on team feedback
- Document lessons learned and process improvements
- Ensure processes remain lightweight and valuable rather than bureaucratic
- Encourage team members to suggest process improvements

## Templates

This directory may also include templates for common documents:

- Pull request templates
- Issue templates
- Meeting agenda templates
- Decision record templates
- Retrospective templates
