## Purpose

The purpose of this documentation is to:

1. Identify potential risks that could affect project success
2. Assess the probability and impact of identified risks
3. Develop strategies to mitigate or respond to risks
4. Track and monitor risks throughout the project lifecycle

## Directory Contents

The risk management documentation is organized by:

- **Risk Registers**: Comprehensive lists of identified risks
- **Risk Assessments**: Detailed assessments of risk probability and impact
- **Mitigation Plans**: Plans for mitigating or responding to risks
- **Risk Reports**: Reports on risk status and trends
- **Templates**: Templates for risk management documents
