# Project Charters Documentation

This directory contains project charter documents for the CollectiveMind project. Project charters formally authorize projects and provide project managers with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities.

## Purpose

The purpose of this documentation is to:

1. Formally authorize projects and define their scope
2. Document project objectives, stakeholders, and constraints
3. Establish project governance and decision-making authority
4. Provide a reference for project planning and execution

## Directory Contents

The project charters documentation is organized by:

- **Active Charters**: Charters for currently active projects
- **Completed Charters**: Charters for completed projects
- **Templates**: Templates for creating new project charters
- **Guidelines**: Guidelines for developing project charters
- **Examples**: Example project charters for reference

## Charter Components

A complete project charter includes:

2. **Project Purpose**: Why the project is being undertaken
3. **Project Objectives**: Specific, measurable objectives
4. **Project Scope**: What is included and excluded from the project

11. **Governance**: Project governance structure and decision-making authority
12. **Approvals**: Formal approvals from key stakeholders

## Charter Development Process

The charter development process follows these stages:

1. **Initiation**: Identifying the need for a project
2. **Draft Development**: Creating the initial draft of the charter
3. **Stakeholder Review**: Reviewing the charter with key stakeholders
4. **Refinement**: Refining the charter based on feedback
5. **Approval**: Obtaining formal approval from authorized stakeholders
6. **Distribution**: Distributing the charter to project team and stakeholders
7. **Maintenance**: Updating the charter as needed throughout the project

## Charter Governance

Project charters are governed according to these principles:

1. **Ownership**: Each charter has a clear owner (typically the project manager)
2. **Approval Authority**: Charters must be approved by designated authorities
3. **Change Control**: Changes to approved charters follow a formal change control process
4. **Accessibility**: Charters are accessible to all project stakeholders
5. **Alignment**: Charters must align with organizational strategy and objectives
