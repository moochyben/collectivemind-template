# Component Technical Specifications

This directory contains technical specifications for UI/UX components in the CollectiveMind project. These specifications bridge the gap between visual designs and component implementation, providing detailed guidance for front-end development.

## Purpose

The purpose of this documentation is to:

1. Translate visual designs into detailed component specifications
2. Document UI component behavior and interactions
3. Provide implementation guidance for front-end developers
4. Ensure consistency between design intent and component implementation

## Directory Contents

The component specifications are organized by:

- **Components**: Technical specs for reusable UI components
- **Features**: Component specifications for specific features
- **Patterns**: Common interaction pattern specifications
- **Platforms**: Platform-specific component variations

## Component Specification Standards

All component specifications in this directory follow these standards:

1. **Format**: Specifications are created in Markdown with supporting diagrams
2. **Naming Convention**: `[component]-[variant]-spec.md`
3. **Detail Level**: Comprehensive specifications including:
   - Component states
   - User interactions
   - Props and properties
   - Accessibility requirements
   - Edge cases
4. **Diagrams**: Component structure and interaction flow diagrams

## Key Documentation Areas

- **[Core Components](./components/)**: Base component specifications
- **[Feature Components](./features/)**: Feature-specific component specs
- **[Interaction Patterns](./patterns/)**: Common interaction specifications
- **[Responsive Patterns](./responsive/)**: Responsive behavior specs

## Component Specification Structure

Each component specification includes:

1. **Overview**: Brief description of the component
2. **Visual Reference**: Links to designs in Figma
3. **Component API**: Props, events, and methods
4. **States & Variants**: All possible states and variations
5. **Interaction Behavior**: Detailed interaction specifications
6. **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance requirements
7. **Technical Requirements**: Implementation requirements
8. **Usage Guidelines**: When and how to use the component

## Component Specification Process

1. **Design Review**: Review final designs and prototypes
2. **Component Analysis**: Break down into component structure
3. **API Design**: Define component interface
4. **Behavior Specification**: Document all interactions
5. **Developer Review**: Review with front-end team
6. **Documentation**: Create detailed specification
7. **Final Review**: Review with design and development

## Tools

- **Documentation**: Markdown
- **Diagramming**: Figma, Draw.io, Mermaid
- **Collaboration**: Figma, GitHub
