# Version Control Guidelines for Design Assets

**Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: March 2, 2025  
**Author**: Claude  
**Status**: Approved

## Purpose

This document outlines the guidelines and best practices for version control of design assets in the CollectiveMind project. Proper version control ensures that:

1. Design history is preserved and can be referenced
2. Multiple team members can collaborate effectively
3. Changes can be tracked and attributed
4. Previous versions can be restored if needed
5. Design and development remain synchronized

## Scope

These guidelines apply to all design assets in the CollectiveMind project, including:

- Figma design files
- Wireframes
- Prototypes
- User flow diagrams
- Design system components
- Design documentation
- Design specifications

## Version Control Systems

### Figma Version History

For Figma files:

1. **Auto-save**: Figma automatically saves versions of your work. However, you should:
   - Create named versions at significant milestones
   - Add descriptive comments to named versions
   - Use the "View Version History" feature to review changes

2. **Naming Versions in Figma**:
   - Use the format: `v[Major].[Minor].[Patch] - [Brief Description]`
   - Example: `v1.2.0 - Updated color system`

### Git for Design Documentation

For design documentation and exported assets:

1. **Repository Structure**:
   - Store design documentation in the `/documentation/design` directory
   - Store exported design assets in the appropriate subdirectories

2. **Branching Strategy**:
   - Use feature branches for significant design changes
   - Branch naming convention: `design/[feature-name]`
   - Create pull requests for review before merging to main

3. **Commit Messages**:
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Format: `[Type]: [Brief description] - [Details]`
   - Types: `Add`, `Update`, `Remove`, `Fix`
   - Example: `Update: Dashboard wireframes - Revised layout based on user feedback`

## Versioning Scheme

All design assets should follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

1. **MAJOR**: Significant redesigns or changes that are not backward compatible
2. **MINOR**: New features or significant updates that maintain compatibility
3. **PATCH**: Small updates, bug fixes, or refinements

### Examples:

- `v1.0.0`: Initial release of a design
- `v1.1.0`: Added new features to the design
- `v1.1.1`: Fixed minor issues in the design
- `v2.0.0`: Complete redesign or major changes

## File Naming Conventions

### Design Files

Format: `[Project]-[Feature]-[Type]-v[Version].[Extension]`

Examples:
- `CM-Dashboard-Wireframe-v1.2.0.fig`
- `CM-UserProfile-Prototype-v2.0.1.fig`

### Exported Assets

Format: `[Project]-[Feature]-[Type]-[Context]-v[Version].[Extension]`

Examples:
- `CM-Button-Component-Primary-v1.0.0.png`
- `CM-Onboarding-Flow-Mobile-v2.1.0.png`

## Documentation Requirements

When updating design assets, ensure the following documentation is included:

1. **Version Number**: Clear indication of the current version
2. **Change Log**: Summary of changes from previous versions
3. **Date**: When the update was made
4. **Author**: Who made the changes
5. **Rationale**: Why the changes were made

## Synchronization with Development

To ensure design and development remain synchronized:

1. **Design Handoff**:
   - Tag significant design versions that are handed off to development
   - Use the format: `design-handoff-[feature]-v[version]`

2. **Implementation Status**:
   - Track which design versions have been implemented
   - Document any deviations between design and implementation

3. **Design Reviews**:
   - Conduct regular reviews to ensure implementation matches design
   - Document discrepancies and required updates

## Archiving Strategy

For maintaining a clean workspace while preserving history:

1. **Active Files**: Keep current and in-progress designs in their respective directories
2. **Archived Files**: Move obsolete designs to an `archived` subdirectory
3. **Archiving Process**:
   - Add an `[ARCHIVED]` prefix to the filename
   - Document the reason for archiving
   - Maintain the version history

## Collaboration Guidelines

When multiple designers are working on the same assets:

1. **Check-in/Check-out Process**:
   - Communicate when you're working on a file
   - Use Figma's multiplayer features appropriately

2. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - Establish a process for resolving conflicting changes
   - Document decisions made during conflict resolution

3. **Review Process**:
   - Have designs reviewed by at least one other designer
   - Document feedback and resulting changes

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Commits**: Make small, frequent commits rather than large, infrequent ones
2. **Meaningful Descriptions**: Provide clear descriptions of changes
3. **Link to Issues**: Reference related issues or tickets in commit messages
4. **Branch Management**: Keep branches short-lived and focused on specific features
5. **Pull Request Reviews**: Have design changes reviewed before merging
6. **Version Tagging**: Tag significant versions for easy reference
7. **Backup Strategy**: Ensure regular backups of design files outside of version control

## Tools and Resources

1. **Figma Version History**: Built-in version control for Figma files
2. **Git**: Version control for documentation and exported assets
3. **GitHub/GitLab**: Platforms for managing Git repositories
4. **Abstract**: Version control specifically for design files (if used)
5. **Zeplin/InVision**: Design handoff tools with versioning capabilities

## Training and Support

## Review and Updates

These guidelines will be reviewed and updated quarterly to ensure they remain effective and aligned with team needs and tools.
