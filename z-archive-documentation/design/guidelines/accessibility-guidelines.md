**Status**: Approved

## Purpose

This document outlines the accessibility guidelines and best practices for the CollectiveMind project. These guidelines ensure that our products are usable by people with a wide range of abilities and disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities.

## Scope

These guidelines apply to all aspects of the CollectiveMind project, including:

- User interface design
- Visual design
- Interaction design
- Content creation
- Development implementation
- Testing and validation

## Accessibility Standards

CollectiveMind follows the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 at the AA level. All designs and implementations should meet or exceed these standards.

### Key WCAG 2.1 AA Requirements

1. **Perceivable**
   - Text alternatives for non-text content
   - Captions and alternatives for multimedia
   - Content that can be presented in different ways
   - Content that is easier to see and hear

2. **Operable**
   - Functionality available from a keyboard
   - Users have enough time to read and use content
   - Content that doesn't cause seizures or physical reactions
   - Users can easily navigate and find content

3. **Understandable**
   - Text that is readable and understandable
   - Content that appears and operates in predictable ways
   - Users are helped to avoid and correct mistakes

4. **Robust**
   - Content that is compatible with current and future user tools

## Design Guidelines

### Color and Contrast

1. **Color Contrast**
   - Text and interactive elements must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against their background
   - Large text (18pt or 14pt bold) must have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1
   - Use the [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to verify contrast ratios

2. **Color Independence**
   - Do not use color as the only means of conveying information
   - Always pair color with another visual indicator (text, icon, pattern)
   - Ensure the interface is usable when viewed in grayscale

### Typography

1. **Text Size and Scaling**
   - Base font size should be at least 16px
   - All text must be resizable up to 200% without loss of content or functionality
   - Use relative units (em, rem) instead of absolute units (px)

2. **Line Height and Spacing**
   - Line height should be at least 1.5 times the font size
   - Paragraph spacing should be at least 2 times the font size
   - Letter spacing should be at least 0.12 times the font size

3. **Font Selection**
   - Use simple, readable fonts
   - Avoid decorative or script fonts for body text
   - Ensure sufficient distinction between similar characters (e.g., I, l, 1)

### Layout and Structure

1. **Responsive Design**
   - Design for different viewport sizes and orientations
   - Ensure content reflows when zoomed to 400%
   - Maintain logical reading order when content reflows

2. **Content Structure**
   - Use proper heading hierarchy (H1-H6)
   - Group related elements visually and semantically
   - Provide clear visual boundaries between sections

3. **Navigation**
   - Provide multiple ways to navigate (menu, search, sitemap)
   - Ensure consistent navigation across pages
   - Provide skip navigation links

### Forms and Inputs

1. **Form Design**
   - Label all form controls clearly and descriptively
   - Group related form elements with fieldsets and legends
   - Provide clear instructions and error messages

2. **Input Methods**
   - Support keyboard navigation and operation
   - Ensure all interactive elements have sufficient touch targets (at least 44x44px)
   - Support alternative input methods (voice, switch devices)

### Interactive Elements

1. **Focus Indicators**
   - Ensure all interactive elements have a visible focus state
   - Focus indicators should have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent colors
   - Do not remove focus outlines without providing an alternative

2. **Hover and Active States**
   - Provide clear visual feedback for hover and active states
   - Ensure hover/focus states do not trigger unexpected content changes
   - Allow users to hover without triggering actions

3. **Animations and Motion**
   - Provide controls to pause, stop, or hide any moving content
   - Avoid content that flashes more than 3 times per second
   - Respect user preferences for reduced motion

## Content Guidelines

### Text Content

1. **Readability**
   - Use clear, simple language (aim for grade 9 reading level)
   - Break content into manageable chunks
   - Use descriptive headings and subheadings

2. **Links and Buttons**
   - Use descriptive link text that makes sense out of context
   - Avoid generic phrases like "click here" or "learn more"
   - Indicate when links open in a new window or download files

### Non-Text Content

1. **Images**
   - Provide alternative text for all images
   - Make alt text descriptive and contextual
   - Use empty alt text for decorative images

2. **Audio and Video**
   - Provide captions for all video content
   - Provide transcripts for audio content
   - Provide audio descriptions for video when necessary

3. **Icons and Symbols**
   - Pair icons with text labels
   - Ensure icons are recognizable and consistent
   - Provide text alternatives for icons that convey meaning

## Implementation Guidelines

### Semantic HTML

1. **Document Structure**
   - Use proper HTML5 semantic elements (header, nav, main, section, article, footer)
   - Ensure the document has a logical heading structure
   - Use landmarks to define page regions

2. **ARIA Roles and Attributes**
   - Use ARIA roles and attributes when HTML semantics are insufficient
   - Follow the "first rule of ARIA" - don't use ARIA when native HTML elements will do
   - Test ARIA implementations with screen readers

### Keyboard Accessibility

1. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
   - Maintain a logical tab order
   - Provide keyboard shortcuts for common actions

2. **Focus Management**
   - Manage focus during interactions (e.g., opening/closing modals)
   - Ensure focus is never trapped
   - Return focus to a logical position after interactions

### Screen Reader Support

1. **Text Alternatives**
   - Provide text alternatives for all non-text content
   - Use aria-label, aria-labelledby, and aria-describedby appropriately
   - Test with screen readers to ensure content is understandable

2. **Dynamic Content**
   - Announce dynamic content changes using aria-live regions
   - Manage focus when content changes
   - Provide status messages for important updates

## Testing and Validation

### Automated Testing

1. **Tools**
   - Use automated tools like Axe, WAVE, or Lighthouse
   - Integrate accessibility testing into CI/CD pipelines
   - Understand the limitations of automated testing

2. **Regular Audits**
   - Conduct regular accessibility audits
   - Address issues by priority (critical, serious, moderate)
   - Document and track progress over time

### Manual Testing

1. **Keyboard Testing**
   - Test all functionality using only a keyboard
   - Verify logical tab order
   - Ensure all interactive elements are operable

2. **Screen Reader Testing**
   - Test with multiple screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
   - Verify that all content is announced correctly
   - Check that dynamic updates are properly announced

3. **User Testing**
   - Conduct testing with users who have disabilities
   - Include users with different assistive technologies
   - Gather feedback on usability, not just technical compliance
