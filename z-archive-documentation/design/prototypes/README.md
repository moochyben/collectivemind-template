# Prototypes Documentation

This directory contains interactive prototypes for the CollectiveMind project. Prototypes are medium to high-fidelity representations of user interfaces that demonstrate functionality, interactions, and visual design.

## Purpose

The purpose of this documentation is to:

1. Provide interactive demonstrations of user interfaces
2. Test user flows and interactions before development
3. Gather feedback on design solutions
4. Serve as a reference for developers during implementation

## Directory Contents

The prototypes are organized by:

- **Feature**: Prototypes specific to individual features
- **User Flow**: Prototypes that demonstrate specific user journeys
- **Version**: Prototypes organized by version or iteration
- **Fidelity Level**: Prototypes organized by fidelity (medium, high)

## Prototype Standards

All prototypes in this directory follow these standards:

1. **Format**: Prototypes are created in Figma with interactive elements
2. **Naming Convention**: `[feature]-[flow]-[version].fig`
3. **Documentation**: Each prototype includes documentation of interactions
4. **Sharing**: Prototypes are shared via Figma links with view/comment access

## Key Prototypes

- **User Onboarding**: [Onboarding Flow](./onboarding/)
- **Dashboard Experience**: [Dashboard Interactions](./dashboard/)
- **Feature-specific**: [Feature Prototypes](./features/)
- **Mobile Experience**: [Mobile Prototypes](./mobile/)

## Accessing Prototypes

Prototypes can be accessed in several ways:

1. **Figma Links**: Direct links to interactive Figma prototypes
2. **Exported Videos**: Recorded demonstrations of prototype interactions
3. **Embedded Prototypes**: Prototypes embedded in documentation

## Related Documentation

For related information, please refer to:

- [Design System](../design-system/): Design system components and guidelines
- [Wireframes](../wireframes/): Low-fidelity wireframes that precede prototypes
- [User Flows](../user-flows/): User journey and flow diagrams

## Prototype Creation Process

1. **Wireframing**: Create wireframes to establish layout and structure
2. **Visual Design**: Apply visual design elements from the design system
3. **Interaction Design**: Add interactive elements and transitions
4. **Testing**: Test the prototype for usability and functionality
5. **Iteration**: Refine the prototype based on feedback
6. **Documentation**: Document the prototype and add to this repository

## Tools

- **Primary Tool**: [Figma](https://figma.com)
- **Alternative Tools**: Adobe XD, InVision, Principle

## Contributing

When contributing prototypes:

1. Follow the prototype standards outlined above
2. Use components from the design system
3. Document all interactions and states
4. Include a brief description of the prototype's purpose
5. Follow the [design contribution workflow](../../process/workflows/design-workflow.md)
