## Overview

This document outlines the workflow for creating, reviewing, updating, and maintaining documentation within the CollectiveMind project. Following this workflow ensures that documentation remains accurate, up-to-date, and valuable to all stakeholders.

## Documentation Lifecycle

Documentation follows a lifecycle from creation to retirement:

1. **Planning**: Identify documentation needs and scope
2. **Creation**: Draft initial documentation
3. **Review**: Peer review and approval
4. **Publication**: Make documentation available to intended audience
5. **Maintenance**: Regular updates and improvements
6. **Archival/Retirement**: Archive or remove outdated documentation

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Documentation Owner

- Responsible for the overall quality and accuracy of a document
- Ensures documentation is kept up-to-date
- Coordinates reviews and updates
- Responds to feedback and questions

### Subject Matter Expert (SME)

- Provides technical expertise and content
- Reviews documentation for technical accuracy
- Helps identify documentation needs
- Contributes to technical content

### Documentation Reviewer

- Reviews documentation for clarity, completeness, and adherence to standards
- Provides feedback on structure and organization
- Checks for consistency with other documentation
- Verifies links and references

### Documentation Approver

- Provides final approval before publication
- Ensures documentation meets quality standards
- Verifies that all required reviews have been completed
- Authorizes publication

## Workflow Stages

### 1. Planning

#### Identify Documentation Needs

- Determine what documentation is needed
- Identify the target audience
- Define the scope and objectives
- Select the appropriate documentation type and template

#### Create Documentation Plan

- Assign roles (owner, contributors, reviewers)
- Set deadlines for drafts, reviews, and publication
- Identify dependencies and related documentation
- Determine where the documentation will be stored

### 2. Creation

#### Initial Setup

- Create a new branch in the repository (if applicable)
- Select the appropriate template
- Set up the document structure
- Add required metadata

#### Content Development

- Write the initial draft
- Include all required sections
- Add diagrams, code examples, and other supporting materials
- Follow the [Documentation Standards](../standards/documentation-standards.md)

#### Self-Review

- Review for technical accuracy
- Check grammar and spelling
- Verify formatting and links
- Ensure compliance with documentation standards

### 3. Review

#### Submission for Review

- Create a pull request (if using Git)
- Notify assigned reviewers
- Provide context and any specific areas for focus

#### Technical Review

- SME reviews for technical accuracy
- Verifies that procedures work as documented
- Checks that code examples are correct
- Ensures all technical details are accurate and complete

#### Editorial Review

- Check for clarity and readability
- Review grammar, spelling, and punctuation
- Ensure consistent terminology
- Verify adherence to style guidelines

#### Addressing Feedback

- Review and address all feedback
- Discuss conflicting feedback with reviewers
- Make necessary revisions
- Document resolution of feedback

#### Final Review

- Final check by documentation owner
- Verify all feedback has been addressed
- Ensure document meets quality standards
- Submit for approval

### 4. Publication

#### Approval

- Final approval by designated approver
- Verification that all required reviews are complete
- Confirmation that documentation meets standards

#### Publishing

- Merge pull request to main branch (if using Git)
- Update version information
- Ensure proper categorization and tagging
- Make documentation available to the intended audience

#### Announcement

- Notify relevant stakeholders of new/updated documentation
- Highlight key changes or additions
- Provide links to the documentation
- Solicit initial feedback

### 5. Maintenance

#### Regular Reviews

- Schedule periodic reviews (quarterly, bi-annually, or annually)
- Check for outdated information
- Verify links and references
- Update examples and screenshots as needed

#### Responding to Feedback

- Monitor feedback channels
- Address reported issues promptly
- Track feedback and improvements
- Update documentation based on user needs

#### Version Updates

- Update documentation when related code or processes change
- Maintain version history
- Clearly mark changes between versions
- Consider backward compatibility needs

### 6. Archival/Retirement

#### Evaluation

- Assess if documentation is still relevant
- Determine if it should be updated, archived, or removed
- Consider impact on related documentation

#### Archival Process

- Move to archive location if needed for historical reference
- Update status to "Archived"
- Remove from active documentation listings
- Update links in related documentation

## Documentation Types and Workflows

Different types of documentation may have specific workflow considerations:

### Feature Documentation

- Created during feature planning
- Updated throughout development
- Reviewed by product and engineering teams
- Published before feature release

### Technical Documentation

- Created during technical design
- Updated as implementation details change
- Reviewed by engineering team
- Published alongside code changes

### Process Documentation

- Created when establishing new processes
- Updated when processes change
- Reviewed by process stakeholders
- Published before process implementation

### User Documentation

- Created during feature development
- Updated based on user feedback
- Reviewed by product team and user representatives
- Published with feature release

## Tools and Templates

### Git Workflow

```
# Create a new branch for documentation
git checkout -b docs/feature-name

# Make changes to documentation
# Commit changes with meaningful messages
git commit -m "Add documentation for feature X"

# Push changes and create pull request
git push origin docs/feature-name
```

### Documentation Templates

Templates are available in the `documentation/process/templates` directory:

- [Feature Documentation Template](../templates/feature-template.md)
- [Technical Architecture Template](../templates/technical-architecture-template.md)
- [Sprint Planning Template](../templates/sprint-planning-template.md)

### Review Checklist

Use this checklist during the review process:

- [ ] Documentation follows the standard template
- [ ] All required sections are included
- [ ] Content is technically accurate
- [ ] Grammar and spelling are correct
- [ ] Formatting is consistent and follows standards
- [ ] Links and references are valid
- [ ] Images have alt text
- [ ] Code examples are correct and tested
- [ ] Document is clear and understandable for the target audience

## Handling Special Cases

### Urgent Documentation Updates

For critical updates (security issues, major bugs):

1. Identify the urgency and impact
2. Expedite the review process
3. Obtain verbal approval if necessary
4. Publish the update immediately
5. Follow up with standard review process

### Collaborative Documentation

For documents with multiple contributors:

1. Assign a primary owner
2. Define sections for each contributor
3. Establish a coordination process
4. Use collaborative tools effectively
5. Schedule regular sync meetings

### Documentation Debt

When documentation falls behind:

1. Identify and catalog documentation debt
2. Prioritize updates based on impact
3. Allocate dedicated time for documentation sprints
4. Consider temporary notices for known outdated sections
5. Track progress on reducing documentation debt

## Metrics and Improvement

### Documentation Quality Metrics

- Accuracy: Number of reported errors
- Completeness: Coverage of features and processes
- Freshness: Time since last review/update
- Usability: User feedback and satisfaction
- Discoverability: Search effectiveness and navigation

### Continuous Improvement

- Collect and analyze feedback
- Identify common issues and patterns
- Refine templates and processes
- Provide documentation training
- Share best practices and examples
