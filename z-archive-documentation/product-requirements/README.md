# Product Requirements Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) for the CollectiveMind project. These documents serve as the definitive source of truth for feature specifications, acceptance criteria, and implementation status.

## Purpose

The PRDs in this directory aim to:

1. Document the complete requirements for each feature
2. Provide clear acceptance criteria for implementation
3. Track the current implementation status of features
4. Identify gaps between requirements and implementation
5. Prioritize future development efforts
6. Serve as a reference for product managers, developers, and stakeholders

## Directory Structure

The product requirements documentation is organized into the following subdirectories:

- **[Features](./features/)**: Detailed documentation for individual features
  - Each feature is documented in its own subdirectory following the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name`
  - Features include comprehensive documentation covering requirements, design, implementation, and testing
- **[Roadmap](./roadmap/)**: Product roadmap visualization and planning tools
  - Interactive timeline visualization
  - Feature summary reports
  - Guidelines for product and project managers
  - Scripts and tools for roadmap management

## Feature Documentation Structure

Each feature directory contains the following documentation:

1. **Feature Request (`feature-request.md`)**: Initial feature concept and justification
2. **Product Requirements Document (`PRD.md`)**: Detailed feature requirements and specifications
3. **Technical Specification (`technical-specification.md`)**: Technical implementation details
4. **UI/UX Design (`ui-ux-design.md`)**: User interface and experience specifications
5. **Implementation Plan (`implementation-plan.md`)**: Development approach and timeline
6. **Test Plan (`test-plan.md`)**: Testing strategy and test cases
7. **Supporting Directories**: Visual references, implementation notes, and Cursor AI integration guidance

## Document Structure

Each PRD follows a consistent structure to ensure comprehensive coverage of all aspects of a feature:

1. **Overview**: High-level description of the feature
2. **Background**: Context and rationale for the feature
3. **Goals and Success Metrics**: Objectives and measurable outcomes
4. **User Stories and Acceptance Criteria**: Detailed user needs and verification points
5. **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional specifications
6. **Data Model**: Entity definitions with field specifications
7. **User Experience**: Workflow descriptions and mockup references
8. **Technical Considerations**: Implementation notes and integration points
9. **Acceptance Criteria Tracking**: Current implementation status
10. **Gap Analysis**: Identification of missing functionality
11. **Implementation Recommendations**: Prioritized development roadmap
12. **Analysis Methodology**: Approach used to develop the PRD
13. **Tracking System**: Implementation completeness and priority matrices
14. **Timeline**: Estimated development schedule
15. **Open Questions**: Unresolved issues requiring decisions
16. **Appendix**: Reference materials and additional information

## Cursor Implementation Directions

Each technical document includes a "Cursor Implementation Directions" section that provides specific guidance for using Cursor AI to implement the feature, including:

- **Code Structure**: File paths and organization for implementation
- **Implementation Order**: Step-by-step guidance for Cursor to follow
- **Key Functions/Components**: Essential elements to implement with descriptions
- **Testing Approach**: How to test the implementation
- **Related Cursor Rules**: Specific rules to reference during implementation

## Roadmap Tools

The roadmap directory contains tools for visualizing and managing the product roadmap:

- **[Roadmap Visualizer](./roadmap/RoadmapVisualizer.tsx)**: Interactive timeline visualization component
- **[Feature Summary](./roadmap/feature-summary.md)**: Comprehensive list of features grouped by category
- **[Product Manager Guidelines](./roadmap/product-manager-guidelines.md)**: Guidelines for product managers
- **[Project Manager Guidelines](./roadmap/project-manager-guidelines.md)**: Guidelines for project managers
- **[Update Scripts](./roadmap/update-roadmap.js)**: Scripts for updating the roadmap based on documentation

## Feature Lifecycle

Features go through the following lifecycle stages:

1. **Proposed**: Initial feature idea proposed and captured in a feature request
2. **Specified**: Feature requirements and specifications defined in the PRD
3. **Designed**: UI/UX design and technical specifications completed
4. **Planned**: Implementation plan and test plan created
5. **Implemented**: Feature implemented in code according to specifications
6. **Tested**: Feature tested against acceptance criteria and test plan
7. **Released**: Feature released to users with appropriate documentation
8. **Maintained**: Feature maintained and improved based on user feedback

## Using These Documents

### For Product Managers
- Use these PRDs to track feature completeness and plan development sprints
- Reference acceptance criteria when validating implemented features
- Update implementation status as features are developed
- Use gap analysis to prioritize future development efforts
- Utilize the roadmap tools to visualize and communicate the product timeline

### For Developers
- Reference requirements and data models during implementation
- Use acceptance criteria to guide feature development
- Update code references in the tracking tables as features are implemented
- Consult technical considerations for implementation guidance
- Follow Cursor Implementation Directions for AI-assisted development

### For Stakeholders
- Review PRDs to understand feature capabilities and limitations
- Reference implementation status to understand current system capabilities
- Use timeline estimates for planning and resource allocation
- Provide input on open questions to guide feature development
- View the roadmap visualization for a high-level overview of the product plan

## Creating a New Feature

To create documentation for a new feature:

1. Create a new directory using the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name` (use the current date)
2. Copy the template files from `documentation/process/templates/feature-documentation/`
3. Fill in each document with the appropriate information
4. Ensure all technical documents include the required "Cursor Implementation Directions" section
5. Get reviews from relevant stakeholders (product, design, engineering)
6. Update documentation as the feature evolves

## Maintenance Guidelines

To maintain the accuracy and usefulness of these PRDs:

1. Update implementation status as features are developed
2. Add code references to tracking tables when implementing features
3. Revise requirements as needed based on user feedback and business needs
4. Document any deviations from original requirements with rationale
5. Update data models as database schema evolves
6. Review and update PRDs at least quarterly to ensure accuracy
7. Keep the roadmap visualization up to date with the latest feature timelines
8. Use the provided templates when creating new feature documentation

## Best Practices

When documenting features:

1. **Be specific**: Provide concrete details rather than vague descriptions
2. **Use examples**: Include examples to illustrate requirements and behaviors
3. **Consider edge cases**: Document how the feature should handle exceptional situations
4. **Link related documents**: Reference related features, technical docs, or external resources
5. **Include visuals**: Use diagrams, mockups, and screenshots to clarify concepts
6. **Update regularly**: Keep documentation in sync with the actual implementation
7. **Version control**: Track major changes to feature specifications
8. **Seek feedback**: Get input from all stakeholders to ensure completeness
9. **Provide clear Cursor directions**: Ensure Cursor Implementation Directions are comprehensive
10. **Reference Cursor rules**: Identify and reference relevant rules in the `.cursor/rules/` directory
