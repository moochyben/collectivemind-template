# Inventory of Analysis Documents

**Date**: March 2, 2025  
**Compiled by**: Claude  

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive inventory of all `ANALYSIS.md` files across the CollectiveMind documentation directory structure. Each analysis document examines the current state of a specific directory, identifies strengths and issues, and proposes improvements to enhance organization, completeness, and usability of the documentation in that area.

## Analysis Document Structure

All analysis documents follow a consistent structure based on the [folder analysis template](./process/templates/folder-analysis-template.md):

1. **Header**: Date, analyst, directory path
2. **Overview**: Brief introduction to the analysis
3. **Folder Purpose and Scope**: Summary of the directory's purpose
4. **Current State Assessment**: Evaluation of documentation structure, completeness, and quality
5. **Key Findings**: Strengths and issues identified
6. **Improvement Roadmap**: Prioritized list of improvements
7. **Leading Practices Reference**: Summary of industry leading practices
8. **Progress Tracking**: Summary of improvements needed and implemented
