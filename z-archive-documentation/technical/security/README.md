## Purpose

Security documentation serves to:

1. **Define Security Architecture**: Document the security components and controls
2. **Guide Implementation**: Provide guidelines for secure development and deployment
3. **Ensure Compliance**: Document adherence to regulatory and industry standards
4. **Support Audits**: Provide evidence for security audits and assessments
5. **Manage Risks**: Document security risks and mitigation strategies
6. **Respond to Incidents**: Outline procedures for security incident response

## Directory Structure

> **Note**: The following directories are planned and will be populated as part of our documentation improvement initiative.

The security documentation is organized into the following directories:

- **[architecture/](./architecture/)** *(Planned)*: Security architecture and design documents
- **[policies/](./policies/)** *(Planned)*: Security policies and procedures
- **[guides/](./guides/)** *(Planned)*: Implementation guides and best practices
- **[compliance/](./compliance/)** *(Planned)*: Compliance and regulatory documentation
- **[assessments/](./assessments/)** *(Planned)*: Security assessment and audit reports
- **[templates/](./templates/)** *(Planned)*: Templates for security documentation

## Security Standards

CollectiveMind follows these security standards:

1. **Zero Trust Architecture**: Implementation of zero trust security principles
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights for users and processes
4. **Data Protection**: Encryption for data at rest and in transit
5. **Access Control**: Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
6. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging
7. **Incident Response**: Defined procedures for security incidents

## Documentation Structure

Each security document includes:

1. **Purpose**: Security objective and goals
2. **Scope**: Systems, data, or processes covered
3. **Roles**: Responsibilities for implementation and maintenance
4. **Requirements**: Security requirements and controls
5. **Implementation**: How to implement security controls
6. **Verification**: How to verify control effectiveness
7. **Maintenance**: How to maintain security controls
8. **References**: Related documents and standards

## Best Practices

When implementing security controls:

1. Follow the principle of least privilege
2. Implement defense in depth
3. Validate all inputs and sanitize data
4. Use strong encryption for sensitive data
5. Implement comprehensive logging
6. Regularly update security patches
7. Conduct security testing
8. Monitor security events
9. Document security decisions
10. Maintain incident response readiness

## Tools and Resources

> **Note**: The following tools and resources are planned and will be created as part of our documentation improvement initiative.

- **[Security Checklist](./tools/checklist/)** *(Planned)*: Security implementation checklist
- **[Testing Tools](./tools/testing/)** *(Planned)*: Security testing tools and scripts
- **[Audit Tools](./tools/audit/)** *(Planned)*: Security audit and assessment tools
- **[Templates](./templates/)** *(Planned)*: Security documentation templates
