## Purpose

Deployment documentation serves to:

1. **Define Infrastructure**: Document the infrastructure architecture and components
2. **Guide Setup**: Provide instructions for setting up environments
3. **Standardize Deployment**: Establish consistent deployment procedures
4. **Support Operations**: Enable effective monitoring and maintenance
5. **Ensure Reliability**: Document disaster recovery and high availability strategies
6. **Facilitate Scaling**: Outline approaches for scaling the application

## Directory Structure

> **Note**: The following directories are planned and will be populated as part of our documentation improvement initiative.

The deployment documentation is organized into the following directories:

- **[infrastructure/](./infrastructure/)** *(Planned)*: Infrastructure documentation
- **[environments/](./environments/)** *(Planned)*: Environment configurations
- **[procedures/](./procedures/)** *(Planned)*: Deployment procedures
- **[operations/](./operations/)** *(Planned)*: Operations documentation
- **[templates/](./templates/)** *(Planned)*: Deployment templates
- **[scripts/](./scripts/)** *(Planned)*: Deployment scripts

## Deployment Standards

CollectiveMind follows these deployment standards:

1. **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure defined in code
2. **Automated Deployments**: Automated deployment processes
3. **Environment Parity**: Consistent environment configurations
4. **Zero-Downtime**: Zero-downtime deployment strategies
5. **Rollback Ready**: Quick rollback capabilities
6. **Monitoring First**: Comprehensive monitoring setup
7. **Security Focus**: Security-first deployment approach

## Documentation Structure

Each deployment document includes:

1. **Overview**: Deployment purpose and scope
2. **Architecture**: Infrastructure components
3. **Prerequisites**: Required setup and access
4. **Procedures**: Step-by-step instructions
5. **Validation**: Success verification steps
6. **Monitoring**: Monitoring and alerting
7. **Rollback**: Rollback procedures
8. **References**: Related documentation

## Best Practices

When implementing deployments:

1. Use infrastructure as code
2. Automate deployment processes
3. Implement proper monitoring
4. Configure alerting
5. Enable auto-scaling
6. Maintain security
7. Document procedures
8. Test rollbacks
9. Version configurations
10. Monitor performance

## Tools and Resources

> **Note**: The following tools and resources are planned and will be created as part of our documentation improvement initiative.

- **[Deployment Templates](./templates/deployment/)** *(Planned)*: Deployment templates
- **[Infrastructure Templates](./templates/infrastructure/)** *(Planned)*: IaC templates
- **[Configuration Templates](./templates/config/)** *(Planned)*: Config templates
- **[Script Library](./scripts/library/)** *(Planned)*: Common scripts
