# Solution Architecture Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to the overall solution architecture of the project, including system design, component interactions, and technical decisions.

## Contents

> **Note**: The following documents are planned and will be created as part of our documentation improvement initiative.

- **[System Architecture Diagrams]** *(Planned)*: Visual representations of system architecture
- **[Component Interaction Models]** *(Planned)*: Documentation of component interactions
- **[Technical Decision Records]** *(Planned)*: Records of architectural decisions
- **[Integration Patterns]** *(Planned)*: Integration patterns and strategies
- **[Non-Functional Requirements]** *(Planned)*: Implementation of non-functional requirements
- **[Technology Stack]** *(Planned)*: Documentation of technology choices

## Purpose

The solution architecture documentation serves to:

1. **Provide System Overview**: Illustrate the high-level architecture and component relationships
2. **Document Design Decisions**: Record and explain key architectural decisions and their rationales
3. **Guide Implementation**: Establish patterns and practices for consistent development
4. **Support Maintenance**: Enable easier understanding of system components for future maintenance
5. **Facilitate Onboarding**: Help new team members understand the overall system design

## Architecture Documentation Types

This directory includes several types of architecture documents:

> **Note**: The following documentation types are planned and will be created as part of our documentation improvement initiative.

- **[Architecture Overview]** *(Planned)*: High-level diagrams and descriptions of the entire system
- **[Component Specifications]** *(Planned)*: Detailed documentation of individual system components
- **[Integration Patterns]** *(Planned)*: Standard approaches for component integration
- **[Technical Decision Records]** *(Planned)*: Documentation of key technical decisions and their rationales
- **[Non-Functional Requirements]** *(Planned)*: Implementation strategies for performance, security, scalability, etc.
- **[Technology Stack]** *(Planned)*: Documentation of technologies used and their purposes

## Using This Documentation

When working with the system architecture:

1. Start with the high-level architecture overview to understand the big picture
2. Refer to component specifications for detailed implementation guidance
3. Follow established integration patterns when connecting components
4. Consult technical decision records to understand the reasoning behind architectural choices
5. Consider non-functional requirements in all implementation decisions
6. Update this documentation when making significant architectural changes

## Best Practices

When contributing to the solution architecture:

1. Maintain clear separation of concerns between components
2. Design for scalability, maintainability, and performance
3. Document all significant architectural decisions with rationales
4. Consider security implications at every architectural layer
5. Ensure backward compatibility or provide clear migration paths
6. Update documentation when architecture evolves

## Related Documentation

Solution architecture documentation relates to:
- [Technical Architecture](../../): Technical documentation overview
- [API Documentation](../../apis/): API specifications and documentation
- [DevOps Documentation](../../devops/): Deployment and operations
- [Security Documentation](../../security/): Security architecture

## Review Schedule

To ensure solution architecture documentation stays current:

- Architecture Overview: Review quarterly or when major changes occur
- Component Specifications: Update when components change
- Integration Patterns: Review semi-annually or when patterns change
- Technical Decisions: Document as decisions are made
- Technology Stack: Update when technologies change
