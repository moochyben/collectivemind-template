## Purpose

Infrastructure documentation serves to:

1. **Define Architecture**: Document infrastructure architecture and components
2. **Guide Implementation**: Provide infrastructure implementation guidance
3. **Ensure Security**: Document security measures and compliance
4. **Support Operations**: Enable effective infrastructure operations
5. **Maintain Reliability**: Document high availability and disaster recovery
6. **Enable Scaling**: Document scaling strategies and procedures

## Directory Structure

> **Note**: The following directories are planned and will be populated as part of our documentation improvement initiative.

The infrastructure documentation is organized into the following directories:

- **[cloud/](./cloud/)** *(Planned)*: Cloud infrastructure documentation
- **[iac/](./iac/)** *(Planned)*: Infrastructure as Code documentation
- **[monitoring/](./monitoring/)** *(Planned)*: Monitoring and observability
- **[security/](./security/)** *(Planned)*: Security documentation
- **[templates/](./templates/)** *(Planned)*: Infrastructure templates
- **[scripts/](./scripts/)** *(Planned)*: Infrastructure scripts

## Infrastructure Standards

CollectiveMind follows these infrastructure standards:

1. **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure defined in code
2. **Cloud-Native**: Cloud-native architecture and services
3. **High Availability**: Redundant and fault-tolerant design
4. **Security First**: Security integrated at every layer
5. **Automated Operations**: Automated infrastructure management
6. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Full observability coverage
7. **Cost Optimization**: Efficient resource utilization

## Documentation Structure

Each infrastructure document includes:

1. **Overview**: Infrastructure component purpose
2. **Architecture**: Component design and structure
3. **Configuration**: Setup and configuration
4. **Security**: Security considerations
5. **Operations**: Operational procedures
6. **Monitoring**: Monitoring setup
7. **Maintenance**: Maintenance procedures
8. **References**: Related documentation

## Best Practices

When implementing infrastructure:

1. Use infrastructure as code
2. Implement proper monitoring
3. Ensure high availability
4. Follow security best practices
5. Optimize for performance
6. Consider cost efficiency
7. Document configurations
8. Maintain backups
9. Plan for scaling
10. Enable automation

## Tools and Resources

> **Note**: The following tools and resources are planned and will be created as part of our documentation improvement initiative.

- **[Cloud Templates](./templates/cloud/)** *(Planned)*: Cloud templates
- **[IaC Templates](./templates/iac/)** *(Planned)*: IaC templates
- **[Monitoring Templates](./templates/monitoring/)** *(Planned)*: Monitoring templates
- **[Script Library](./scripts/library/)** *(Planned)*: Common scripts

## Related Documentation

Infrastructure documentation relates to:
- [Technical Architecture](../architecture/): System architecture
- [Deployment Documentation](../deployment/): Deployment procedures
