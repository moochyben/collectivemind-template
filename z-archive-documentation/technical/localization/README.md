## Purpose

Localization documentation serves to:

1. **Define Strategy**: Document the overall internationalization and localization strategy
2. **Guide Implementation**: Provide guidelines for implementing internationalized features
3. **Document Processes**: Outline translation and localization workflows
4. **Support Global Users**: Enable effective support for users in different regions
5. **Ensure Consistency**: Maintain consistent user experience across languages
6. **Track Coverage**: Monitor language coverage and localization status

## Directory Structure

> **Note**: The following directories are planned and will be populated as part of our documentation improvement initiative.

The localization documentation is organized into the following directories:

- **[strategy/](./strategy/)** *(Planned)*: Localization strategy documentation
- **[implementation/](./implementation/)** *(Planned)*: Implementation guidelines
- **[translation/](./translation/)** *(Planned)*: Translation process documentation
- **[testing/](./testing/)** *(Planned)*: Testing documentation
- **[tools/](./tools/)** *(Planned)*: Localization tools documentation
- **[templates/](./templates/)** *(Planned)*: Documentation templates

## Localization Standards

CollectiveMind follows these localization standards:

1. **Unicode Support**: Full Unicode compliance
2. **String Externalization**: All strings externalized
3. **Context Provision**: Context for all strings
4. **Cultural Adaptation**: Cultural considerations
5. **RTL Support**: Full RTL language support
6. **Format Localization**: Localized date/number formats
7. **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive QA process

## Documentation Structure

Each localization document includes:

1. **Overview**: Localization component purpose
2. **Strategy**: Strategic approach and goals
3. **Implementation**: Technical implementation
4. **Process**: Workflows and procedures
5. **Testing**: Validation procedures
6. **Tools**: Required tools and setup
7. **Maintenance**: Update procedures
8. **References**: Related documentation

## Best Practices

When implementing localization:

1. Design for translation
2. Provide string context
3. Handle text expansion
4. Support RTL layouts
5. Localize all formats
6. Consider cultural aspects
7. Test thoroughly
8. Maintain glossaries
9. Document processes
10. Monitor coverage

## Tools and Resources

> **Note**: The following tools and resources are planned and will be created as part of our documentation improvement initiative.

- **[Translation Tools](./tools/translation/)** *(Planned)*: Translation management
- **[Testing Tools](./tools/testing/)** *(Planned)*: Localization testing
- **[Style Guides](./tools/style/)** *(Planned)*: Language style guides
- **[Script Library](./tools/scripts/)** *(Planned)*: Common scripts
