# AI-Driven Documentation System - Detailed Requirements

## 1. Context Management & Incremental Learning

- The AI must maintain a **rolling context window**, allowing it to remember relevant historical details while preventing overflow.
- The system should **incrementally build and refine documentation** rather than overwriting entire sections, ensuring continuity.
- AI should **prioritize high-impact updates** based on frequency of changes, criticality, and dependencies.

## 2. Automated Documentation Generation & Maintenance

- AI must generate and maintain structured Markdown files across:
  - **Product Requirements** (features, roadmap, templates)
  - **Technical Documentation** (APIs, architecture, security, integrations, etc.)
  - **Support Guides** (FAQs, troubleshooting, accessibility)
  - **Market Research** (competitive analysis, user research)
  - **Legal Compliance** (contracts, policies, external regulations)
  - **Process Documentation** (workflows, onboarding, agile processes)
- AI should **auto-tag and categorize new content** for searchability.
- The system should be able to **suggest and auto-generate missing sections** based on gaps detected in documentation.

## 3. External Input Processing & Business Impact Analysis

- AI should continuously **monitor, parse, and assess external inputs**, such as:
  - Regulatory changes affecting compliance documentation.
  - Competitor updates influencing market research.
  - User feedback from emails, tickets, or discussions affecting product requirements.
- AI should **automatically assess the impact** of these inputs and suggest necessary updates or risk alerts.

## 4. User Feedback Loop & Validation

- The system should **aggregate and process user feedback**, including:
  - Feature requests and issue reports (linking them to relevant documentation updates).
  - Internal comments on documentation that require refinement.
- AI should **highlight proposed changes for human validation** before committing to updates.
- The system should track **revision history with AI-generated rationale** for transparency.

## 5. Prioritization & Intelligent Updates

- AI must analyze and prioritize documentation updates based on:
  - Frequency of change.
  - Impact level (e.g., security updates take precedence over minor UI adjustments).
  - Dependencies (e.g., an API change may impact multiple modules).
- AI should suggest **“critical path” updates** that need immediate review.

## 6. Automation & Integration

- The AI must integrate with **version control systems (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) to update documentation automatically.**
- AI should support **CI/CD pipelines** by automatically generating documentation updates as part of code commits.
- The system must be able to **schedule periodic reviews** and alert stakeholders to required updates.

## 7. Interface & User Interaction

- AI should provide a **command-line interface (CLI) and web-based UI** for managing documentation updates.
- Users should be able to:
  - Request specific updates.
  - Review AI-generated suggestions before applying them.
  - Provide feedback that AI can incorporate into future updates.

## 8. Scalability & Security

- AI-generated documentation should be **version-controlled** to prevent unauthorized modifications.
- Access permissions should be configurable to control **who can approve AI-generated changes**.
- The system should be designed to **scale across multiple projects and repositories**.
