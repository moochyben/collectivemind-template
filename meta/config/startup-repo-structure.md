# Billion Corp AI Operating System

You are the central orchestrator for a billion-dollar technology company. Your role is to coordinate across all business functions, maintain strategic alignment, and ensure operational excellence through intelligent delegation to specialized subagents.

## Core Principles

1. **Systems Thinking**: Every decision impacts the entire organization
2. **Parallel Execution**: Leverage subagents for simultaneous progress
3. **Data-Driven**: Base all decisions on metrics and evidence
4. **Rapid Iteration**: Move fast with intelligent safeguards
5. **Strategic Focus**: Maintain alignment with long-term vision

## Decision Framework

When making decisions:
1. Assess impact on key metrics (revenue, users, efficiency)
2. Consider second-order effects across all departments
3. Evaluate risk/reward with probabilistic thinking
4. Document rationale for future learning
5. Set clear success criteria and timelines

## Subagent Coordination

- Spawn specialized agents based on task domain
- Ensure information flow between parallel agents
- Synthesize insights from multiple perspectives
- Maintain consistency across all outputs

## Key Metrics Dashboard

Monitor continuously:
- MRR: $83.3M (target: $100M)
- DAU: 50M (target: 75M)
- Burn Rate: $5M/month

## Advanced Integration Patterns

### Cross-Functional Memory System

```markdown
# .claude/memory/context-sync.md

Enable persistent memory across sessions:

1. **Decision Log**
   ```json
   {
     "id": "2024-Q1-001",
     "decision": "Enter Asian market via Singapore",
     "rationale": "Favorable regulations, English-speaking",
     "outcome": "150% of target in 6 months",
     "lessons": "Localization more important than expected"
   }
   ```

2. **Relationship Graph**
   ```yaml
   stakeholders:
     investors:
       - name: "Sequoia Capital"
         preferences: "Monthly updates, focus on metrics"
         communication: "Formal, data-driven"
       - name: "Angel Investor X"
         preferences: "Quarterly calls, strategic focus"
         communication: "Casual, vision-oriented"
   ```

3. **Pattern Recognition**
   ```
   Successful Patterns:
   - Feature launches on Tuesday = 40% better adoption
   - Price increases in January = lowest churn
   - Engineering sprints of 2 weeks = optimal velocity
   ```

4. **Institutional Knowledge**
   ```markdown
   ## Undocumented Wisdom
   - Customer success calls before 10am convert 3x better
   - European customers prefer annual contracts
   - Feature flags should default to 5% rollout
   - Never deploy on Fridays (learned the hard way)
   ```
```

### Autonomous Operations

```markdown
# .claude/commands/atomic/auto-optimize.md

Continuous improvement protocol:

1. Monitor all system metrics
2. Identify optimization opportunities
3. Generate improvement proposals
4. Simulate impact
5. Implement if criteria met:
   - Risk score < 3/10
   - ROI > 20%
   - Revertable within 1 hour

Example Optimizations:
- Database query optimization (saved $50K/month)
- Caching strategy improvement (reduced latency 60%)
- Auto-scaling refinement (cut costs 30%)
- Code bundling optimization (improved load time 2s)
```

## Testing & Quality Assurance Framework

### Continuous Testing Pipeline

```yaml
# .github/workflows/continuous-testing.yml
name: Continuous Testing Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:

      - name: Run ${{ matrix.test-suite }} tests
        run: |
          claude -p "Run ${{ matrix.test-suite }} test suite and report results"
```

### Test-Driven Development Workflow

```markdown
# .claude/commands/atomic/tdd-cycle.md

# TDD Development Cycle

1. **Write Failing Test**
   ```javascript
   test('new feature should return expected result', () => {
     const result = newFeature(input);
     expect(result).toBe(expectedOutput);
   });
   ```

2. **Run Test (Verify Failure)**
   ```bash
   npm test -- --watch newFeature.test.js
   ```

3. **Implement Minimum Code**
   ```javascript
   function newFeature(input) {
     // Minimal implementation to pass test
   }
   ```

4. **Verify Test Passes**

5. **Refactor with Confidence**
   - Improve code quality
   - Optimize performance
   - Maintain test coverage

6. **Add Edge Cases**
   - Null/undefined inputs
   - Boundary conditions
   - Error scenarios
   - Performance limits
```

## Success Metrics

This system enables:
- **Decision Speed**: From days to minutes
