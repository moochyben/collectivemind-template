Version: 1.0.0
Last Updated: 2025-03-23

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for deploying the nested rules system in the CollectiveMind repository. The plan details how to structure, organize, and apply the rule system to maintain high-quality documentation with AI assistance.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Week 1-2)

#### Create Rules Directory Structure
1. Create a `.rules` directory at the repository root
2. Create subdirectories for global and domain-specific rules:
   ```
   .rules/
   ├── global/
   │   ├── documentation-standards.md
   │   └── ai-interaction-standards.md
   ├── strategy/
   ├── market-research/
   ├── product-requirements/
   ├── technical/
   └── process/
   ```
3. Copy the global rules files into the `.rules/global/` directory

#### Define Rule Cross-Referencing System
1. Establish a standard syntax for rule references: `@rule:{path-to-rule}`
2. Document the reference system in a README.md file in the `.rules` directory
3. Create a rule validation script to check reference integrity

#### Create AI Agent Prompt Templates
1. Create a `prompts` directory within `.rules`
2. Develop basic prompt templates for documentation review and refresh
3. Test prompt templates with sample documentation

- [ ] Document findings and improvements

### Phase 4: Automation Implementation (Week 7-9)

#### Set Up Review Triggers
1. Implement time-based review schedules:
   - Strategy documentation: Annual review
   - Market research: Quarterly review
   - Product requirements: Monthly review
   - Technical documentation: Bi-monthly review
   - Process documentation: Quarterly review
2. Create event-based triggers:
   - New feature addition
   - Major version release
   - Market changes
   - Team structure changes
3. Develop manual review request process

#### Create Documentation Review Workflow
1. Document the review process:
   - Trigger identification
   - Rule application
   - Issue identification
   - Improvement recommendation
   - PR creation
   - Review and approval
   - Implementation
2. Develop templates for review reports
3. Create PR templates for AI-suggested changes

#### Implement Metrics Tracking
1. Define documentation quality metrics:
   - Rule compliance rate
   - Documentation freshness
   - Issue resolution time
   - Documentation coverage
2. Create a reporting dashboard
3. Implement trend analysis

#### Action Items
- [ ] Set up review schedules and triggers
- [ ] Document the review workflow
- [ ] Create review report templates
- [ ] Implement PR templates
- [ ] Define and implement metrics tracking

### Phase 5: Testing and Refinement (Week 10-12)

#### Comprehensive Documentation Audit
1. Apply rule system to all documentation
2. Generate compliance reports
3. Identify patterns and common issues
4. Prioritize improvements

#### Rule Refinement
1. Identify gaps in rule coverage
2. Refine rules based on audit findings
3. Resolve any conflicts or ambiguities
4. Update examples and validation criteria

#### AI Agent Optimization

2. Identify areas for prompt improvement
3. Enhance rule interpretation capabilities
4. Optimize review and refresh processes

#### Training and Documentation

## Success Criteria

The nested rules system implementation will be considered successful if it achieves:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Rules cover all major documentation areas
2. **Consistent Application**: Rules are applied consistently across the repository
3. **Measurable Improvement**: Documentation quality metrics show positive trends
4. **Effective Automation**: AI agents effectively apply rules and suggest improvements
5. **Team Adoption**: Team members understand and follow the rule system
6. **Maintainability**: The rule system can be easily updated and expanded
7. **Time Efficiency**: Documentation maintenance requires less manual effort

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Rule complexity becomes unmanageable | High | Medium | Start with minimal set of high-quality rules; implement clear hierarchy |
| Team resistance to AI-assisted documentation | Medium | Medium | Demonstrate value through time savings; provide training |
| AI agents struggle with complex rule application | High | Medium | Develop detailed prompts; maintain human oversight |
| Rule conflicts create confusion | Medium | High | Establish clear precedence rules; regularly audit for conflicts |
| Implementation requires excessive resources | Medium | Medium | Phased approach; focus on high-value areas first |

## Next Steps

1. Begin Phase 1 implementation immediately
2. Schedule weekly review meetings to track progress
3. Conduct demo of rule system after Phase 2
4. Gather feedback after each phase
5. Adjust implementation plan based on feedback
6. Present final system to all stakeholders after Phase 5

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach for deploying the nested rules system in the CollectiveMind repository. By following this phased approach, the team can systematically build a comprehensive rule system that leverages AI assistance to maintain high-quality documentation. Regular reviews and refinements will ensure the system remains effective and adaptable to changing project needs.
