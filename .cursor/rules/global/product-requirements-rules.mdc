User stories must follow the format:
```
As a [role],
I want [capability],
So that [benefit].
```

Where:
1. Role is a specific user type or persona
2. Capability is a concrete action or feature
3. Benefit is the value received from the capability
4. Additional details include:
   - Acceptance criteria (3-5 testable conditions)
   - Priority (must-have, should-have, nice-to-have)
   - Size estimate (story points or t-shirt size)
   - Dependencies (other stories that must be completed first)

## Application Examples

# Feature Request: Collaborative Editing

Last Updated: 2025-03-23

## Problem Statement
Teams using CollectiveMind currently cannot edit the same document simultaneously, resulting in version conflicts, lost work, and coordination challenges. This creates friction in collaborative workflows and reduces productivity.

## User Needs and Pain Points
- Users need to collaborate on documents in real-time
- Current workarounds involve manual coordination via chat or email
- Version conflicts occur frequently (reported in 35% of user feedback sessions)
- Users lose work when overwriting each other's changes
- Teams struggle to maintain a single source of truth for documents

## Business Objectives
This feature supports our strategic goals to:
- Enhance team collaboration capabilities (Strategic Goal 2)
- Reduce workflow friction (Strategic Goal 3.2)
- Increase user engagement and retention (Strategic Goal 1.3)

## Success Metrics
- 50% reduction in reported version conflicts
- 25% increase in document editing sessions
- 30% reduction in time spent on document coordination
- 20% increase in multi-user document engagement

## Stakeholders
- Product Manager: Jane Smith (decision authority)
- Engineering Lead: John Doe (technical feasibility)
- UX Designer: Alice Johnson (user experience)
- Key Customers: Enterprise Advisory Board (requirements validation)

## Initial Scope
In scope:
- Real-time collaborative text editing
- User presence indicators
- Edit conflict resolution
- Change history and versioning

Out of scope:
- Real-time collaborative media editing
- Offline collaboration
- External user sharing

## Priority Level
Must-have (Priority 1)

## Dependencies
- User authentication system enhancements
- Real-time data synchronization infrastructure
- Document permission model updates

# Collaborative Editing Feature PRD

Last Updated: 2025-03-23

## Feature Overview
The Collaborative Editing feature enables multiple users to simultaneously edit the same document in real-time, with changes visible to all participants immediately. The feature includes user presence indicators, cursor position sharing, and conflict resolution mechanisms.

## Background
Our user research indicates that teams spend significant time coordinating document edits and resolving version conflicts. This feature addresses these pain points by providing a seamless real-time collaboration experience that maintains a single source of truth while preserving the history of changes.

## Goals and Success Metrics
### Goals
1. Enable real-time collaborative document editing
2. Reduce version conflicts and coordination overhead
3. Provide visibility into who is editing what and when
4. Maintain a reliable audit trail of document changes

### Success Metrics
- 50% reduction in reported version conflicts
- 25% increase in document editing sessions
- 30% reduction in time spent on document coordination
- 20% increase in multi-user document engagement

## User Stories
### US-1: Real-time Editing
As a team member,
I want to edit a document while seeing others' changes in real-time,
So that I can collaborate efficiently without version conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. Changes appear to all users within 500ms
2. Multiple users can edit different parts of the document simultaneously
3. Changes are preserved when users edit the same section
4. Users receive visual indication when edit conflicts occur
5. The system automatically resolves conflicts when possible

### US-2: User Presence
As a team member,
I want to see who else is viewing or editing a document,
So that I can coordinate my work with others.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. User avatars appear in the document header when users are viewing
2. User cursors are visible with name labels when users are editing
3. User presence information updates within 2 seconds of status change
4. The system shows when users are actively typing vs. idle
5. Presence information persists only while users have the document open

2. Validating the structure and content of each document type
3. Ensuring acceptance criteria are specific and testable
4. Verifying proper formatting of user stories
5. Checking for appropriate cross-referencing between documents
6. Validating alignment between requirements and strategic goals
7. Ensuring Cursor Implementation Directions are complete
8. Verifying the current lifecycle stage is properly documented
9. Checking for completeness of technical specifications
10. Validating that all open questions are clearly documented
