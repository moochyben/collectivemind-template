## Application Examples

### Example 1: Workflow Documentation
```markdown
# Document Approval Workflow

Last Updated: 2025-03-23

## Purpose
This workflow defines the standard process for reviewing and approving documentation within the CollectiveMind repository, ensuring quality, consistency, and appropriate stakeholder input before publication.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **Document Author**: Creates and submits document for review
- **Subject Matter Expert (SME)**: Reviews for technical accuracy
- **Documentation Specialist**: Reviews for compliance with documentation standards
- **Approver**: Makes final approval decision
- **Administrator**: Updates documentation status and notifies stakeholders

## Workflow Diagram
[Insert BPMN diagram here]

## Process Steps

### 1. Document Creation
**Description**: Author creates or updates document following documentation standards
**Responsible**: Document Author
**Inputs**: Documentation requirements, templates
**Outputs**: Draft document
**Tools**: Markdown editor, repository access
**Duration**: Varies based on document complexity (typically 1-5 days)

### 2. Initial Review Request
**Description**: Author submits document for review
**Responsible**: Document Author
**Inputs**: Draft document
**Outputs**: Review request with metadata
**Tools**: Repository pull request system
**Duration**: 1 hour

### 3. Technical Review
**Description**: SME reviews document for technical accuracy and completeness
**Responsible**: Assigned Subject Matter Expert
**Inputs**: Draft document
**Outputs**: Technical review comments
**Tools**: Repository review system
**Duration**: 1-3 days
**Decision Point**: If major technical issues found, return to step 1; otherwise, proceed

[Additional steps would follow...]

## Exception Handling
- **Urgent Approval Needed**: For time-sensitive documents, the expedited approval process can be used (see [Expedited Approval Workflow](mdc:expedited-approval.md))
- **Reviewer Unavailable**: If primary reviewer is unavailable for >2 days, escalate to backup reviewer
- **Conflicting Feedback**: If conflicting feedback is received, document owner arranges resolution meeting with reviewers

## Key Performance Indicators
- Average time from submission to approval
- Percentage of documents requiring multiple review cycles
- Number of post-approval issues identified
- Reviewer participation rate
