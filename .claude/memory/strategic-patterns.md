## Startup Strategic Decision Anti-Patterns

### Low-Impact Startup Decisions (Score 3.0-5.9)

#### Anti-Pattern: Premature Scaling Without PMF
**Description**: Decisions that optimize for scale before achieving product-market fit
**Warning Signs**:
- Low PMF contribution scores despite high operational efficiency
- Focus on growth metrics without customer validation
- Resource allocation away from customer discovery

**Constitutional Solutions**:
- Apply PMF filters before scaling decisions
- Use constitutional self-critique to identify premature optimization
- Revise scaling decisions to include PMF validation requirements

#### Anti-Pattern: Resource Inefficiency for Marginal Gains
**Description**: Decisions that consume significant resources for minimal strategic advancement
**Warning Signs**:
- High cost relative to strategic impact
- Low runway extension despite efficiency claims
- Stakeholder value limited to single constituency

**Constitutional Solutions**:
- Mandatory cost-efficiency analysis in constitutional assessment
- Alternative generation focused on resource optimization
- Constitutional revision to find higher-leverage approaches

### Failed Startup Decisions (Score <3.0)

#### Anti-Pattern: Mission Drift and Strategic Misalignment
**Description**: Decisions that move away from core startup mission and strategic objectives
**Warning Signs**:
- Negative scores in mission or vision alignment
- Conflicts with startup values (efficiency, customer obsession, learning)
- Threatens startup survival or runway

**Constitutional Solutions**:
- Mandatory constitutional analysis before any strategic decision
- Escalation process for decisions with alignment scores below 5.0
- Constitutional revision requirement for all low-scoring decisions

## Startup Constitutional Learning Patterns

### Self-Critique Effectiveness for Startups

#### Successful Startup Self-Critique Patterns
- **PMF Impact Assessment**: Every decision evaluated for product-market fit contribution
- **Resource Constraint Reality**: Honest assessment of resource limitations drives creativity
- **Customer Perspective Integration**: Regular customer viewpoint consideration prevents founder bias
- **Runway Impact Analysis**: Long-term financial implications considered for all decisions

#### Startup Self-Critique Improvement Areas
- **Founder Confirmation Bias**: Tendency to confirm pre-existing product beliefs
- **Customer vs. User Confusion**: Conflating users with paying customers
- **Technical Solution Bias**: Overemphasizing technical elegance over customer value
- **Growth Vanity Metrics**: Focusing on impressive but non-revenue metrics

### Constitutional Revision Patterns for Startups

#### High-Value Startup Revisions
- **Customer Validation Integration**: Adding customer feedback loops to product decisions
- **Resource Optimization**: Finding ways to achieve objectives with fewer resources
- **PMF Acceleration**: Adjusting timeline to accelerate customer validation
- **Multi-Learning Opportunities**: Structuring decisions to generate multiple insights

#### Common Startup Revision Mistakes
- **Over-Complicating MVPs**: Making simple solutions unnecessarily complex
- **Analysis Paralysis**: Endless revision without customer testing
- **Perfect Product Syndrome**: Revising decisions to build perfect rather than testable solutions
- **Resource Underestimation**: Failing to account for true implementation costs

## Startup Decision Velocity Patterns

### Fast, High-Quality Startup Decisions
- **Clear PMF Metrics**: Well-defined product-market fit indicators enable rapid assessment
- **Customer Access**: Direct customer communication channels accelerate validation
- **Simple Strategic Framework**: Focused mission/vision enables quick alignment checks
- **Resource Clarity**: Known runway and constraints speed decision evaluation

### Startup Decision Bottlenecks
- **Customer Access Limitations**: Difficulty reaching target customers slows validation
