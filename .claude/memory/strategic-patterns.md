## Strategic Decision Anti-Patterns

### Low-Impact Strategic Decisions (Score 3.0-5.9)

#### Anti-Pattern: Tactical Optimization Without Strategic Context
**Description**: Decisions that improve tactical metrics but don't advance strategic objectives
**Warning Signs**:
- High operational efficiency but low strategic alignment scores
- Focus on short-term metrics without long-term vision connection
- Limited stakeholder value creation beyond immediate beneficiaries

**Constitutional Solutions**:
- Apply strategic filters before tactical optimization
- Use constitutional self-critique to identify broader strategic implications
- Revise tactical decisions to include strategic value creation

#### Anti-Pattern: Stakeholder Value Trade-offs
**Description**: Decisions that create value for some stakeholders at the expense of others
**Warning Signs**:
- Uneven stakeholder impact scores
- Short-term shareholder value at expense of customer/employee value
- Mission advancement that conflicts with stated values

**Constitutional Solutions**:
- Deeper stakeholder analysis during constitutional assessment
- Creative alternatives generation to find multi-stakeholder solutions
- Constitutional revision to eliminate unnecessary trade-offs

### Failed Strategic Decisions (Score <3.0)

#### Anti-Pattern: Strategic Misalignment
**Description**: Decisions that actively undermine strategic objectives
**Warning Signs**:
- Negative scores in mission, vision, or values alignment
- Conflicts with multiple strategic pillars
- Stakeholder value destruction

**Constitutional Solutions**:
- Mandatory constitutional analysis before implementation
- Escalation process for decisions with alignment scores below 5.0
- Constitutional revision requirement for all low-scoring decisions

## Constitutional Learning Patterns

### Self-Critique Effectiveness

#### Successful Self-Critique Patterns
- **Question Fundamental Assumptions**: Most breakthroughs come from questioning basic premises
- **Stakeholder Perspective Taking**: Considering decisions from all stakeholder viewpoints reveals hidden issues
- **Long-term Consequence Mapping**: Thinking through 2nd and 3rd order effects improves decision quality
- **Alternative Generation**: Forcing consideration of 3+ alternatives leads to better solutions

#### Self-Critique Improvement Areas
- **Confirmation Bias**: Tendency to seek information that confirms initial decision
- **Stakeholder Weighting**: Overemphasizing certain stakeholder groups in analysis
- **Short-term Focus**: Insufficient consideration of long-term strategic implications
- **Resource Constraint Assumptions**: Accepting resource limitations without exploring creative solutions

### Constitutional Revision Patterns

#### High-Value Revisions
- **Stakeholder Impact Expansion**: Finding ways to create value for previously unconsidered stakeholders
- **Strategic Pillar Integration**: Connecting single-pillar decisions to multiple strategic areas
- **Timeline Optimization**: Adjusting implementation timing for maximum strategic impact
- **Resource Reallocation**: Shifting resources to increase strategic alignment

#### Common Revision Mistakes
- **Over-Engineering Solutions**: Making decisions unnecessarily complex to improve alignment scores
- **Stakeholder Appeasement**: Compromising strategic value to satisfy all stakeholders
- **Perfectionism Paralysis**: Endless revision without implementation
- **Strategic Drift**: Revising decisions so much they lose original purpose

## Strategic Decision Velocity Patterns

### Fast, High-Quality Strategic Decisions
- **Clear Strategic Framework**: Well-defined mission, vision, values enable rapid alignment assessment
- **Practiced Constitutional Process**: Regular use of constitutional analysis increases decision speed
- **Stakeholder Clarity**: Known stakeholder preferences and priorities accelerate impact assessment
- **Pattern Recognition**: Experience with similar decisions enables faster pattern matching

### Strategic Decision Bottlenecks
- **Unclear Strategic Context**: Ambiguous mission/vision requires lengthy clarification before decision-making
- **Complex Stakeholder Dynamics**: Conflicting stakeholder interests slow constitutional resolution
- **Novel Decision Types**: Unprecedented decisions require more extensive constitutional analysis
- **Resource Constraint Complexity**: Multiple resource limitations complicate alternative generation
