# Quick Revenue Forecast: $ARGUMENTS

Generate rapid revenue forecast for $ARGUMENTS (timeframe: "next-quarter", "next-month", "next-year", or specific period).

## Forecasting Framework

### 1. Data Collection
Analyze current performance metrics:
- MRR and ARR trends (last 12 months)
- New customer acquisition rate
- Expansion revenue patterns
- Churn and contraction rates
- Sales pipeline health
- Seasonal patterns and market factors

### 2. Forecasting Models
Apply multiple forecasting methods:

**Linear Trend Model**
- Based on historical growth rates
- Smoothed for seasonal variations
- Weighted for recent performance

**Pipeline-Based Model**
- Current sales pipeline analysis
- Stage-weighted probability scoring
- Historical close rate application

**Cohort-Based Model**
- Customer lifetime value projection
- Retention curve analysis
- Expansion revenue modeling

### 3. Scenario Planning
Generate three scenarios with confidence levels:
- **Conservative (80% confidence)**: Lower growth assumptions
- **Base Case (60% confidence)**: Most likely outcome
- **Optimistic (40% confidence)**: Higher growth potential

## Analysis Components

### Revenue Streams Analysis
Break down forecast by:
- New Business Revenue
- Expansion Revenue (upsells/cross-sells)  
- Renewal Revenue
- Professional Services (if applicable)

### Key Assumptions
Document critical assumptions:
- Market growth rate
- Competitive dynamics
- Product development impact
- Sales team productivity
- Marketing effectiveness
- Economic conditions

### Risk Factors
Identify forecast risks:
- Pipeline concentration
- Customer concentration
- Market saturation
- Competitive threats
- Economic downturns
