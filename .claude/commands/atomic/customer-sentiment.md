# Customer Sentiment Analysis: $ARGUMENTS

Analyze customer sentiment for $ARGUMENTS (customer name, segment, or "all-customers") across all touchpoints and provide actionable insights.

## Analysis Framework

### 1. Data Source Analysis
Gather sentiment indicators from:
- NPS scores and survey responses (last 90 days)
- Support ticket sentiment and escalations

### 2. Sentiment Scoring Algorithm
Calculate composite sentiment score using:
```
Sentiment Score = (NPS√ó0.3) + (Support√ó0.25) + (Usage√ó0.2) + (Social√ó0.15) + (Sales√ó0.1)

Where each component is normalized to 0-10 scale:
- NPS: (Score + 100) / 20

```

### 3. Trend Analysis
