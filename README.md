# CollectiveMind Enterprise Edition

**Scale to billion-dollar operations with AI-native business management**

This repository implements the CollectiveMind methodology at enterprise scale - an AI-orchestrated business management system designed for billion-dollar organizations. CollectiveMind is a principled approach to building AI-native businesses that enables companies to scale efficiently with minimal engineering resources by leveraging Claude Code as the central intelligence layer.

## Overview

This system transforms a traditional business repository into an AI-native operating system where:
- Every department has its own AI persona with specialized expertise
- Complex workflows are orchestrated through parallel AI agents
- Decisions are tracked, learned from, and improved over time
- Information flows seamlessly between departments

**For Early-Stage Companies**: If you're building a startup or scaling to your first $1M ARR, start with [CollectiveMind Startup Edition](https://github.com/moochyben/collectivemind-template/tree/startup-adaptation) for resource-optimized operations.

## Quick Start

1. **Daily Operations**
   ```bash
   claude -p /executive:daily-brief today
   ```

2. **Feature Development**
   ```bash
   claude -p /orchestrators:feature-development new-ai-chat
   ```

3. **Crisis Management**
   ```bash
   claude -p /executive:crisis-response payment-outage
   ```

## Getting Started

### ⚠️ Critical Setup Step

**BEFORE implementing CollectiveMind**, you MUST customize the strategic templates:

1. **Navigate to** `strategy/strategic-context.md`
2. **Replace all [PLACEHOLDER] content** with your organization's information:
   - Mission statement
   - Vision statement  
   - Core values (3-7 recommended)
   - Strategic pillars (3-5 recommended)
   - Strategic priorities (current year)
   - Key performance indicators
3. **Use the customization checklist** at the bottom of the file to ensure completion
4. **Review industry examples** to guide your customization

**Why This Matters**: CollectiveMind's AI agents reference your strategic context for every decision. Without proper customization, the system will not align with your business objectives.

### Implementation Path

1. **Week 1: Strategic Foundation**
   - Customize strategic templates with your organization's context
   - Set up core structure and daily briefings
   - Configure organizational context in CLAUDE.md files

2. **Week 2: Domain Configuration**
   - Configure domain personas for your specific business functions
   - Implement basic AI workflows aligned with your strategic context
   - Set up cross-departmental coordination

3. **Week 3: Multi-Agent Orchestration**
   - Implement multi-agent orchestrators for complex workflows
   - Establish institutional memory and learning systems
   - Deploy strategic decision-making frameworks

4. **Week 4: Optimization & Tuning**
   - Optimize workflows based on initial performance data
   - Refine strategic alignment and decision-making processes
   - Document lessons learned and successful patterns

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with daily-brief and expand
2. **Measure Everything**: Track time savings and quality
3. **Iterate Rapidly**: Refine commands based on usage
4. **Document Patterns**: Build institutional knowledge
5. **Maintain Safety**: Always have manual overrides

## Contributing

This is a living system that evolves with your business. To add new capabilities:

1. Create new commands in `.claude/commands/`
2. Add domain expertise in department `CLAUDE.md` files
3. Document patterns in `.claude/memory/`
4. Share successful workflows with the team

Remember: This system augments human judgment with AI-powered leverage at unprecedented scale. The goal is not to replace human decision-making but to amplify it.
