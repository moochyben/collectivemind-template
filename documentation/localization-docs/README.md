# Localization Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) of the project, including translation processes, cultural adaptations, and multi-language support.

## Purpose

Localization documentation serves to:

1. **Define Strategy**: Document the overall internationalization and localization strategy
2. **Guide Implementation**: Provide guidelines for implementing internationalized features
3. **Document Processes**: Outline translation and localization workflows
4. **Support Global Users**: Enable effective support for users in different regions
5. **Ensure Consistency**: Maintain consistent user experience across languages
6. **Track Coverage**: Monitor language coverage and localization status

## Document Types

This directory includes several types of localization documentation:

- **Localization Strategy**: Overall approach to internationalization and localization
- **Supported Languages**: Documentation of supported languages and regions
- **Translation Process**: Workflows for translating content and interfaces
- **String Management**: Procedures for managing translatable strings
- **Cultural Considerations**: Guidelines for cultural adaptations
- **Date, Time, and Number Formats**: Standards for formatting in different locales
- **RTL Support**: Implementation of right-to-left language support
- **Testing Procedures**: Methods for testing localized interfaces
- **Translation Tools**: Documentation of translation management tools
- **Glossaries and Style Guides**: Language-specific terminology and style guidelines

## Document Structure

Each localization document should follow this general structure:

1. **Overview**: Brief description of the localization aspect being documented
2. **Purpose**: Why the document exists and what it accomplishes
3. **Scope**: What languages, regions, or features are covered
4. **Implementation Guidelines**: How to implement internationalized features
5. **Processes**: Workflows and procedures
6. **Best Practices**: Recommended approaches
7. **Examples**: Examples of proper implementation
8. **References**: Links to related documentation or resources

## Naming Convention

Localization documentation should follow this naming convention:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-localization-topic-name.md
```

For example: `YYYY-MM-DD-translation-process.md` or `YYYY-MM-DD-rtl-support.md`

| Strategy | [YYYY-MM-DD-localization-strategy.md](./YYYY-MM-DD-localization-strategy.md) | [Date] | [Status] |
| Languages | [YYYY-MM-DD-supported-languages.md](./YYYY-MM-DD-supported-languages.md) | [Date] | [Status] |
| Process | [YYYY-MM-DD-translation-process.md](./YYYY-MM-DD-translation-process.md) | [Date] | [Status] |
| Cultural | [YYYY-MM-DD-cultural-considerations.md](./YYYY-MM-DD-cultural-considerations.md) | [Date] | [Status] |

## Best Practices

When creating localization documentation:

1. Document internationalization architecture and patterns
2. Include guidelines for extracting translatable strings
3. Document string context and variable handling
4. Include procedures for handling pluralization
5. Document date, time, and number formatting standards
6. Include guidelines for UI layout that accommodates text expansion
7. Document RTL layout considerations
8. Include translation quality assurance processes
9. Document cultural considerations beyond translation
10. Include glossaries of domain-specific terminology

## Related Documentation

Localization documentation often relates to:
- User Guides in the `user-guides/` directory
- Design Documentation in the `design-docs/` directory
- Development Guidelines in the `process/` directory
- Testing Documentation in the `testing-docs/` directory

## Review Schedule

To ensure localization documentation stays current:

- Localization strategy: Review annually
- Supported languages: Update when language support changes
- Translation process: Review semi-annually
- Cultural considerations: Update when expanding to new regions
- Testing procedures: Review quarterly
