## Documentation Structure

### Directory Organization

Maintain documentation in the following directory structure:

```
documentation/
  ├── project-management/
  │   ├── charters/
  │   ├── plans/
  │   ├── reports/
  │   └── risks/
  ├── agile/
  │   ├── sprints/
  │   │   └── YYYY-MM-DD-sprint-N/
  │   │       ├── plan.md
  │   │       ├── review.md
  │   │       └── retrospective.md
  │   └── ceremonies/
  ├── product-requirements/
  │   ├── features/
  │   └── roadmap/
  └── process/
      ├── roles/
      └── workflows/
```

### File Naming Conventions

- Use kebab-case for all file and directory names
- Include dates in YYYY-MM-DD format for time-bound documents
- Use sequential numbering for recurring documents (e.g., sprint-1, sprint-2)
- Group related documents in appropriately named directories

## Documentation Workflows

### Sprint Documentation

1. **Sprint Planning**
   - Create a sprint directory with the start date:
     ```bash
     mkdir -p documentation/agile/sprints/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-sprint-N
     ```
   - Create sprint planning document:
     ```bash
     touch documentation/agile/sprints/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-sprint-N/plan.md
     ```
   - Include the following in your sprint plan:
     ```markdown
     # Sprint N Plan
     
     **Start Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
     **End Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
     **Sprint Goal:** [Concise goal statement]
     
     ## Team Capacity
     - Team Member 1: X days
     - Team Member 2: Y days
     
     ## Sprint Backlog
     - [ ] User Story 1 (X points)
     - [ ] User Story 2 (Y points)
     
     ## Dependencies
     - Dependency 1 - Owner: Team Member
     - Dependency 2 - Owner: External Team
     
     ## Risks
     - Risk 1 - Mitigation: [Strategy]
     - Risk 2 - Mitigation: [Strategy]
     ```

2. **Sprint Review**
   - Create sprint review document:
     ```bash
     touch documentation/agile/sprints/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-sprint-N/review.md
     ```
   - Update the roadmap to reflect the latest progress:
     ```bash
     cd documentation/product-requirements/roadmap
     ./update-roadmap.sh
     ```

3. **Sprint Retrospective**
   - Create retrospective document:
     ```bash
     touch documentation/agile/sprints/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-sprint-N/retrospective.md
     ```
   - Include the following in your retrospective:
     ```markdown
     # Sprint N Retrospective
     
     ## What Went Well
     - Item 1
     - Item 2
     
     ## What Could Be Improved
     - Item 1
     - Item 2
     
     ## Action Items
     - [ ] Action 1 - Owner: Team Member
     - [ ] Action 2 - Owner: Team Member
     ```

### Status Reporting

1. Create weekly status reports:
   ```bash
   touch documentation/project-management/reports/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-status-report.md
   ```

2. Include the following in your status report:
   ```markdown
   # Status Report: YYYY-MM-DD
   
   ## Executive Summary
   [Brief overview of project status]
   
   ## Sprint Progress
   - Sprint Goal: [Goal]
   - Completed: X of Y stories (Z points)
   - Burndown: [On track/Behind/Ahead]
   
   ## Roadmap Status
   [Include roadmap summary or link]
   
   ## Risks and Issues
   - Risk/Issue 1 - Status: [Open/Mitigated]
   - Risk/Issue 2 - Status: [Open/Mitigated]
   
   ## Next Steps
   - Action 1
   - Action 2
   ```

## Roadmap Management

### Roadmap Maintenance

1. **Regular Updates**: Ensure the roadmap data is updated at least bi-weekly, or whenever significant changes occur
2. **Accuracy Verification**: Validate that feature statuses, timelines, and dependencies are accurately reflected
3. **Progress Tracking**: Monitor feature progress against planned timelines

### Using the Roadmap Tools

1. Generate the latest roadmap visualization and Markdown summary:
   ```bash
   cd documentation/product-requirements/roadmap
   ./update-roadmap.sh --open
   ```

2. Use the roadmap during agile ceremonies:
   - **Sprint Planning**: Review dependencies and upcoming features
   - **Sprint Review**: Update progress and showcase completed features
   - **Backlog Refinement**: Prioritize based on roadmap alignment
   - **Daily Stand-ups**: Reference for context on current work

3. Use the roadmap for stakeholder communications:
   - Generate the Markdown summary before stakeholder meetings
   - Include the roadmap visualization in status reports
   - Use the milestone summary to communicate high-level progress
   - Highlight dependencies and risks that may require stakeholder attention

## Best Practices

### Metrics and Reporting

- Track key project metrics consistently
- Use visualizations to communicate complex information
- Tailor reporting to different stakeholder needs
- Focus on trends rather than point-in-time data
- Connect metrics to business outcomes

## Troubleshooting Common Documentation Issues

1. **Documentation Overload**
   - Focus on high-value documentation
   - Automate routine documentation
   - Use templates to streamline creation
   - Regularly review and retire unnecessary documentation

2. **Inconsistent Updates**
   - Establish clear update cadences
   - Assign specific documentation owners
   - Include documentation updates in ceremonies
   - Implement reminders or automation

3. **Poor Adoption**
   - Demonstrate the value of documentation
   - Make documentation easily accessible
   - Gather feedback on documentation usefulness
   - Adapt documentation approach based on team needs

4. **Disconnected Documentation**
   - Create a documentation map or index
   - Implement consistent cross-linking
   - Use a centralized documentation repository
   - Regularly audit documentation connections

## Conclusion

Effective documentation is a critical aspect of project management. By following these guidelines, you can create and maintain high-quality documentation that improves communication, alignment, and decision-making across the organization.
