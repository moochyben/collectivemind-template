## Document Structure

Each process document should follow this general structure:

1. **Purpose**: What the process aims to achieve
2. **Scope**: What activities, systems, or teams are covered
3. **Roles and Responsibilities**: Who is involved and what they do
4. **Detailed Procedures**: Step-by-step instructions
5. **Inputs and Outputs**: What goes into and comes out of the process
6. **Tools and Resources**: What tools or resources are needed
7. **Metrics and Measurements**: How success is measured
8. **References**: Links to related documentation or resources

## Naming Convention

Process documentation should follow this naming convention:

```
descriptive-process-name.md
```

For example: `documentation-workflow.md` or `feature-development-process.md`

## Best Practices

When creating process documentation:

1. Focus on clarity and simplicity
2. Use diagrams to illustrate complex workflows
3. Include examples where helpful
4. Define roles and responsibilities clearly
5. Document exceptions and edge cases
6. Include decision points and criteria
7. Link to related processes and dependencies
8. Keep procedures up to date with organizational changes
9. Gather feedback from process users
10. Review and update regularly

## Process Improvement

The process improvement cycle includes:

1. **Document Current Process**: Clearly document the existing process
2. **Identify Pain Points**: Gather feedback on issues with the current process
3. **Design Improvements**: Develop changes to address pain points
4. **Test Changes**: Pilot process changes with a small group
5. **Implement Updates**: Roll out improved process to the organization
6. **Monitor and Measure**: Track process metrics to evaluate effectiveness
7. **Iterate**: Continue to refine based on feedback and metrics

## Related Documentation

Process documentation often relates to:
- Project Management Documentation in the `project-management/` directory
- Agile Documentation in the `agile/` directory
- Technical Documentation in the `technical/` directory

## Review Schedule

To ensure process documentation stays current:

- Workflows: Review quarterly or when significant changes occur
- Standards: Review semi-annually
- Templates: Update as needed based on usage feedback
- Role descriptions: Review annually or when organizational structure changes
- Onboarding materials: Review quarterly
- Integration processes: Update when integration methods change
