The process documentation is organized into the following subdirectories:

- **[Workflows](./workflows/)** *(Planned)*: Standard workflows for development, documentation, and other processes
- **[Templates](./templates/)** *(Planned)*: Reusable templates for various documentation types
- **[Standards](./standards/)** *(Planned)*: Coding standards, documentation standards, and other quality guidelines
- **[Onboarding](./onboarding/)** *(Planned)*: Materials and procedures for onboarding new team members
- **[Roles](./roles/)** *(Planned)*: Role-specific guidelines and responsibilities
- **[Operations](./operations/)** *(Planned)*: Technical and business operations documentation
- **[Integrations](./integrations/)** *(Planned)*: Process documentation for integrations with external systems
- **[Rules](./rules/)** *(Planned)*: Organizational rules and governance guidelines

## Document Types

This directory includes several types of process documentation:

- **Workflow Guides**: Step-by-step procedures for completing specific processes
- **Role Descriptions**: Detailed descriptions of responsibilities for specific roles
- **Standards Documents**: Quality standards and best practices
- **Templates**: Reusable formats for creating consistent documentation
- **Onboarding Materials**: Resources for new team members
- **Operational Procedures**: Guidelines for day-to-day operations
- **Integration Processes**: Procedures for working with external systems
- **Governance Documents**: Rules and guidelines for organizational governance

## Document Structure

Each process document should follow this general structure:

1. **Purpose**: What the process aims to achieve
2. **Scope**: What activities, systems, or teams are covered
3. **Roles and Responsibilities**: Who is involved and what they do
4. **Detailed Procedures**: Step-by-step instructions
5. **Inputs and Outputs**: What goes into and comes out of the process
6. **Tools and Resources**: What tools or resources are needed
7. **Metrics and Measurements**: How success is measured
8. **References**: Links to related documentation or resources

## Best Practices

When creating process documentation:

1. Focus on clarity and simplicity
2. Use diagrams to illustrate complex workflows
3. Include examples where helpful
4. Define roles and responsibilities clearly
5. Document exceptions and edge cases
6. Include decision points and criteria
7. Link to related processes and dependencies
8. Keep procedures up to date with organizational changes
9. Gather feedback from process users
10. Review and update regularly

## Process Improvement

The process improvement cycle includes:

1. **Document Current Process**: Clearly document the existing process
2. **Identify Pain Points**: Gather feedback on issues with the current process
3. **Design Improvements**: Develop changes to address pain points
4. **Test Changes**: Pilot process changes with a small group
5. **Implement Updates**: Roll out improved process to the organization
6. **Monitor and Measure**: Track process metrics to evaluate effectiveness
7. **Iterate**: Continue to refine based on feedback and metrics
