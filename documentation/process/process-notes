# AI-Driven Documentation and Development Process  

## 1. Seeding Documentation & Initial Architecture Analysis  

- **Start by seeding** the documentation folders with:  
  - **Current Product Requirements**  
  - **Vision Statement**  
- Once seeded, ask AI to **perform an architecture analysis**, including:  
  - **Tech stack recommendations**  
  - **Infrastructure considerations**  
  - **Scalability and security factors**  

## 2. Personas & Automated PRD Creation  

- **Three Personas** (#personas)  
  - **Step 1:** Use AI to create a **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** for each new feature request. (*Product Manager - PM role*)  
  - **Step 2:** Generate **UX output** within the same chat session. (*UI/UX role*)  
  - **Step 3:** Prompt the **Solution Architect** to review and refine. (*Solution Architect role*)  
  - Store all outputs in the **documentation folder**.  

## 3. AI-Assisted Architecture Planning  

- Use AI to plan system architecture.  
- Ensure **data architecture** is included.  
- Architecture should be reviewed against **user stories** before implementation to align with **data types and structures**.  

## 4. Feature Management, Change Control & Market Research Integration  

- Allow **Product Managers (PMs)** to **add new features** to the PRD based on small suggestions.  
- Implement a **change control process** to track modifications.  
- **Feature or idea ingestion process should include:**  
  - Adding an **activity for market research** before approval.  
  - Integration with an **external market research capability** (possibly an **MCP**) for validation and insights.  
- **Automate feature intake from Trello:**  
  - Have **Cursor AI create a process** to pull **feature ideas from Trello** and store them in the repository.  
  - Ensure ideas are structured consistently and **categorized properly**.  

## 5. Documentation & Code Updates  

- **Enforce documentation updates** when making code changes or at periodic intervals.  
  - Consider setting up a **Pull Request Checklist (PRC)** dedicated to documentation updates.  
  - Automate reminders every **two hours** to prompt documentation updates.  
- Tag and comment **user stories** within the **codebase**.  
- Maintain a **set of personas** to fill out the documentation repository.  

## 6. AI-Driven Instruction & Auto-Updates  

- Use **GPT-3.7** for content **creation** and **GPT-3.5** for **processing**.  
- Automate instruction generation:  
  - AI writes its own **instructions as a reference file**.  
  - It also **tracks areas that need fixes**, structured as **pages/sections**.  
  - AI selects which page to update next dynamically (without prescriptive ordering).  
  - Track and **log all updates**.  
- Maintain a **directory of all guides** for reference.  

## 7. Product Roadmap & Continuous Improvement  

- Store **product roadmap** and **progress tracking** for fixes in the **admin panel**.  
- Maintain a **notepad-style repository** for ideas that can be translated into guides or improvements.  
- Establish a **rule-based submission process** for new ideas:  
  - Ideas for **process improvements** or **code changes** are logged in a folder.  
  - They are automatically categorized and tracked like feature ideas.  
  - A central **Markdown (MD) file** keeps an updated **list of ideas**, including:  
    - **Prioritization**  
    - **Dependencies**  
    - **Status updates**  

## 8. Systematic Code & Documentation Review  

- Implement **default templates** for reviewing:  
  - **Codebase issues**  
  - **Documentation gaps**  
  - **Remediation plans**  
- AI periodically reviews documentation and code for issues.  
- Use **Cursor AI** for review (to maintain full context).  
- Reference 2-3 examples from **Voyagr** to **Collective Mind** for consistency.  

## 9. Pending Items  

- **Develop an analysis approach**, including **prioritization**.  
- **Define and implement the idea submission & categorization process**.

This structured workflow ensures **efficient documentation, automated feature management, AI-driven process optimization, and a seamless transition from idea intake to implementation**.
