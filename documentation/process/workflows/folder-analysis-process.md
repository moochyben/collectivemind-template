# Folder Analysis Process

## Overview

This document outlines the process for maintaining living analysis documents for each folder in the CollectiveMind project. Each folder has a single, continuously updated analysis document that evaluates both documentation and implementation specific to that folder's domain, identifies issues and opportunities, and provides recommendations based on leading practices and innovative ideas.

## Process Goals

- Maintain a single, up-to-date analysis document in each key folder
- Identify issues, gaps, and opportunities for improvement in both documentation and domain-specific implementation
- Provide recommendations based on industry leading practices
- Suggest innovative approaches that could transform or significantly improve current practices
- Track progress on implementing improvements
- Leverage the Cursor Agent for efficient implementation of improvements

## Analysis Approach

### 1. Initial Analysis

1. **Identify Target Folder**: Select a folder with a README file for analysis
2. **Create Analysis Document**: Create a new analysis document directly in the target folder
3. **Review README**: Thoroughly read and understand the README file to identify the folder's purpose and scope
4. **Analyze Documentation**: Evaluate the documentation for completeness, accuracy, clarity, structure, and alignment with best practices
5. **Analyze Implementation** (for technical folders): Evaluate the code aspects specific to the folder's domain (e.g., data architecture, security, APIs)
6. **Identify Issues and Opportunities**: Document specific issues, gaps, and opportunities for improvement
7. **Research Leading Practices**: Research industry leading practices relevant to the folder's domain
8. **Identify Innovation Opportunities**: Identify potential innovative approaches that could transform or significantly improve current practices
9. **Develop Recommendations**: Create specific, actionable recommendations for addressing issues and capitalizing on opportunities
10. **Prioritize Improvements**: Categorize improvements as high priority, medium priority, or future considerations

### 2. Ongoing Updates

1. **Regular Review**: Review the analysis document at least quarterly
2. **Update Assessment**: Update the current state assessment based on changes since the last review
3. **Add New Findings**: Add new issues, opportunities, and recommendations as they are identified
4. **Update Progress**: Update the progress tracking section with implemented improvements
5. **Reprioritize**: Adjust priorities based on new findings and business needs
6. **Document Changes**: Summarize key changes in the "Key Changes Since Last Update" field

## Using the Folder Analysis Template

The [Folder Analysis Template](./templates/folder-analysis-template.md) provides a structured format for creating and maintaining living analysis documents. To use the template:

1. **Create a New File**: Create a new file directly in the target folder
2. **Name the File**: Use the naming convention `ANALYSIS.md` to clearly identify it
3. **Fill in the Template**: Complete all sections of the template based on your analysis
4. **Save and Commit**: Save the file and commit it to the repository
5. **Update Regularly**: Update the document regularly as improvements are implemented and new issues or opportunities are identified

### Template Sections

- **Overview**: Provides a brief introduction to the analysis
- **Analysis Information**: Records metadata about the analysis, including the last update date
- **Folder Purpose and Scope**: Summarizes the purpose and scope of the folder
- **Current State Assessment**: Evaluates the current state of documentation and domain-specific implementation
- **Key Findings**: Documents specific issues and opportunities for improvement
- **Innovation Opportunities**: Identifies potential innovative approaches
- **Improvement Roadmap**: Provides a prioritized roadmap for implementing improvements
- **Leading Practices Reference**: Summarizes relevant industry leading practices
- **Progress Tracking**: Tracks progress on implementing improvements
- **Cursor Agent Instructions**: Provides instructions for the Cursor Agent

## Example Workflow

### Data Architecture Folder Analysis

1. **Initial Analysis**
   - Create a new analysis document: `documentation/technical/architecture/data-architecture/ANALYSIS.md`
   - Review the README file: `documentation/technical/architecture/data-architecture/README.md`
   - Analyze the documentation and data architecture aspects of the codebase
   - Identify issues, opportunities, and recommendations specific to data architecture
   - Research leading practices in data architecture
   - Identify potential innovative approaches for data architecture
   - Prioritize improvements

2. **Implementation**
   - Assign high-priority improvements to team members or the Cursor Agent
   - Implement improvements according to recommendations
   - Update the analysis document with progress

3. **Ongoing Updates**
   - Review the analysis document quarterly
   - Update the assessment based on changes
   - Add new findings and recommendations
   - Update progress tracking
   - Reprioritize improvements as needed

## Technical Folder Considerations

For technical folders, the analysis should focus specifically on the domain of that folder:

### Documentation Analysis

- Evaluate the completeness, accuracy, and clarity of documentation specific to the folder's domain
- Assess alignment with industry documentation standards for that domain
- Identify gaps in domain-specific documentation
- Recommend improvements based on domain-specific documentation best practices

### Domain-Specific Implementation Analysis

- **Data Architecture Folders**: Focus on data modeling, database design, schema evolution, data access patterns, and data governance
- **Security Folders**: Focus on security controls, authentication, authorization, encryption, and security testing
- **API Folders**: Focus on API design, documentation, versioning, error handling, and performance
- **Infrastructure Folders**: Focus on deployment, scaling, monitoring, and reliability
- **Testing Folders**: Focus on test coverage, test types, test automation, and test data management
- **Integration Folders**: Focus on integration patterns, error handling, and system boundaries

Each analysis should only evaluate aspects of the codebase that are relevant to the specific domain of the folder being analyzed.

## Cursor Agent Integration

The analysis documents are designed to work with the Cursor Agent for efficient implementation of improvements. Each improvement includes specific, actionable recommendations that the Cursor Agent can follow to implement the improvement. The agent can be instructed to address specific improvements using the standard command format:

```
Cursor Agent, please implement improvement [ID] from the [Folder Name] analysis and update the analysis document with your progress.
```

When the Cursor Agent completes a task, it should:

1. Update the improvement status in the analysis document
2. Add the improvement to the "Improvements Implemented" section with its name and date
3. Update the improvement counts in the summary table

## Leading Practices Research

To ensure recommendations are based on industry leading practices, consider the following sources:

1. **Industry Standards**: Review relevant industry standards specific to the domain (e.g., ISO, IEEE, NIST)
2. **Technical Communities**: Research best practices from technical communities focused on the domain
3. **Technical Publications**: Review technical publications and blogs from industry leaders in the domain
4. **Open Source Projects**: Analyze similar open source projects for domain-specific best practices
5. **Academic Research**: Review academic research on relevant domain-specific topics
6. **Industry Conferences**: Review presentations and papers from industry conferences focused on the domain
7. **Technical Books**: Consult technical books on domain-specific topics

## Innovation Research

To identify potential innovative approaches, consider the following sources:

1. **Emerging Technologies**: Research emerging technologies that could be applied to the specific domain
2. **Industry Trends**: Analyze industry trends that could impact the specific domain
3. **Academic Research**: Review cutting-edge academic research on domain-specific topics
4. **Startup Ecosystem**: Analyze innovative approaches from relevant startups in the domain
5. **Cross-Industry Applications**: Consider how approaches from other industries could be applied to the domain
6. **Open Innovation Platforms**: Review ideas from open innovation platforms related to the domain
7. **Technical Forecasting**: Consider future technical developments that could impact the domain
