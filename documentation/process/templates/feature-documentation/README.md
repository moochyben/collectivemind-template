# Feature Documentation Templates

This directory contains additional templates for comprehensive feature documentation. These templates provide a standardized approach to documenting all aspects of a feature throughout its lifecycle.

## Purpose

The purpose of these templates is to:

1. Provide a standardized approach to feature documentation
2. Ensure all aspects of a feature are thoroughly documented
3. Support collaboration among product, design, development, and QA teams
4. Create a comprehensive record of feature decisions and implementation details

## Templates Overview

This directory includes the following templates:

- [Product Requirements Document (PRD)](./PRD.md): Template for detailed product requirements
- [Technical Specification](./technical-specification.md): Template for technical implementation details
- [UI/UX Design](./ui-ux-design.md): Template for UI/UX design documentation
- [Implementation Plan](./implementation-plan.md): Template for planning feature implementation
- [Test Plan](./test-plan.md): Template for feature testing strategy and test cases

## Using These Templates

### Feature Documentation Workflow

The typical workflow for feature documentation is:

1. **Feature Conception**: Use the [Feature Template](../feature-template.md) to document the initial feature idea
2. **Feature Approval**: Get stakeholder approval for the feature
3. **Comprehensive Documentation**: For approved features, create a new directory in the `features` directory and use these templates to create comprehensive documentation
4. **Implementation**: Use the documentation to guide implementation
5. **Testing**: Use the test plan to verify implementation
6. **Maintenance**: Update documentation as the feature evolves

### Creating a New Feature

To document a new feature:

1. Create a new directory in the `documentation/features` directory using the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name`
2. Copy the [Feature Template](../feature-template.md) and relevant templates from this directory to your new feature directory
3. Rename the files if necessary according to your project's naming conventions
4. Complete each document as you progress through the feature development lifecycle
5. Update the documents as the feature evolves

## Template Customization

These templates are designed to be comprehensive, but you may need to customize them for your specific needs:

- Add or remove sections as needed
- Adjust the level of detail based on feature complexity
- Modify terminology to match your organization's vocabulary

While customization is encouraged, try to maintain the overall structure for consistency across features.

## Best Practices

When using these templates:

1. **Be Concise**: Focus on clarity and brevity
2. **Use Examples**: Include examples to illustrate complex concepts
3. **Include Visuals**: Add diagrams, mockups, and screenshots where helpful
4. **Cross-Reference**: Link related documents for context
5. **Seek Feedback**: Get input from all stakeholders
6. **Keep Updated**: Maintain documentation as the feature evolves
