# Integration Processes

This directory contains documentation for various integrations used in the Collective Mind project, including setup instructions, usage guides, and best practices.

## Purpose

The purpose of this directory is to provide a centralized location for all integration-related processes and documentation, ensuring that team members can easily find information about how to use and maintain the project's integrations with external systems.

## Available Integrations

- [Confluence MCP](./using-confluence-mcp.md) - Integration with Confluence Cloud using the Machine Callable Program (MCP)
- [Syncing Confluence Pages](./syncing-confluence-pages.md) - Guide for syncing Confluence pages to the local repository

## Integration Standards

When documenting integrations, please follow these standards:

1. **Clear Setup Instructions**: Provide step-by-step setup instructions with all required credentials and configuration details
2. **Usage Examples**: Include practical examples of how to use the integration
3. **Troubleshooting**: Document common issues and their solutions
4. **Security Considerations**: Note any security implications and best practices
5. **Maintenance**: Include information about how to update or maintain the integration

## Adding New Integrations

When adding a new integration:

1. Create a new markdown file in this directory with a descriptive name (e.g., `using-[integration-name].md`)
2. Update this README to include a link to the new integration documentation
3. Ensure the documentation follows the integration standards outlined above
4. Add any necessary configuration files to the appropriate location in the project

## Integration Review Process

Integrations should be reviewed periodically to ensure they remain secure and functional:

1. **Security Review**: Check for any security vulnerabilities or updates needed
2. **Functionality Check**: Verify that the integration still works as expected
3. **Documentation Update**: Update the documentation to reflect any changes
4. **Dependency Review**: Check for updates to dependencies or APIs used by the integration
