# Technical Design Documents

This directory contains Technical Design Documents (TDDs) for the project. These documents detail the technical implementation approach for features and components.

## Purpose

Technical Design Documents serve to:

1. **Define Implementation**: Outline how features will be technically implemented
2. **Document Architecture**: Describe the architecture and component design
3. **Identify Dependencies**: Highlight dependencies and integration points
4. **Address Challenges**: Document technical challenges and their solutions
5. **Guide Development**: Provide technical guidance for the development team

## Document Structure

Each Technical Design Document should follow this general structure:

1. **Overview**: Brief description of the technical solution
2. **Goals**: Technical goals and non-goals
3. **Background**: Technical context and existing systems
4. **Detailed Design**: 
   - Architecture diagrams
   - Component design
   - Data models
   - API specifications
   - Algorithms
5. **Alternative Approaches**: Considered alternatives and why they were rejected
6. **Performance Considerations**: Performance implications and optimizations
7. **Security Considerations**: Security implications and mitigations
8. **Testing Strategy**: Approach to testing the implementation
9. **Deployment and Rollout**: How the feature will be deployed
10. **Open Questions**: Unresolved technical issues
11. **References**: Links to relevant documentation or resources

## Naming Convention

Technical Design Documents should follow this naming convention:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name-design.md
```

For example: `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name-design.md`

## Available Design Documents

| Feature | Document | Last Updated | Status |
|---------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Feature 1 | [YYYY-MM-DD-feature-1-design.md](./YYYY-MM-DD-feature-1-design.md) | [Date] | [Status] |
| Feature 2 | [YYYY-MM-DD-feature-2-design.md](./YYYY-MM-DD-feature-2-design.md) | [Date] | [Status] |
| Feature 3 | [YYYY-MM-DD-feature-3-design.md](./YYYY-MM-DD-feature-3-design.md) | [Date] | [Status] |

## Best Practices

When creating technical design documents:

1. Start with a clear problem statement and goals
2. Include detailed architecture diagrams
3. Document all significant design decisions with rationales
4. Consider performance, security, and scalability implications
5. Address potential failure modes and mitigations
6. Include API specifications where relevant
7. Document data models and database schema changes
8. Consider deployment and rollback strategies
