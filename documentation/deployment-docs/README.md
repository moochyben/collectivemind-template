# Deployment Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to the deployment of the project, including infrastructure setup, environment configurations, and deployment procedures.

## Purpose

Deployment documentation serves to:

1. **Define Infrastructure**: Document the infrastructure architecture and components
2. **Guide Setup**: Provide instructions for setting up environments
3. **Standardize Deployment**: Establish consistent deployment procedures
4. **Support Operations**: Enable effective monitoring and maintenance
5. **Ensure Reliability**: Document disaster recovery and high availability strategies
6. **Facilitate Scaling**: Outline approaches for scaling the application

## Document Types

This directory includes several types of deployment documentation:

- **Infrastructure Architecture**: Diagrams and descriptions of the infrastructure components
- **Environment Configurations**: Configuration details for different environments (dev, staging, production)
- **Deployment Procedures**: Step-by-step guides for deploying the application
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Documentation of continuous integration and deployment pipelines
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Templates and scripts for automated infrastructure provisioning
- **Scaling Strategies**: Approaches for horizontal and vertical scaling
- **Disaster Recovery**: Backup, recovery, and business continuity procedures
- **Monitoring Setup**: Configuration of monitoring tools and alert systems
- **Security Configurations**: Security-related deployment configurations

## Document Structure

Each deployment document should follow this general structure:

1. **Overview**: Brief description of the deployment aspect being documented
2. **Architecture**: Diagrams and descriptions of the relevant components
3. **Prerequisites**: Required tools, access, and knowledge
4. **Detailed Procedures**: Step-by-step instructions
5. **Validation**: How to verify successful deployment
6. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and their solutions
7. **References**: Links to related documentation or resources

## Naming Convention

Deployment documentation should follow this naming convention:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-deployment-topic-name.md
```

For example: `YYYY-MM-DD-production-deployment.md` or `YYYY-MM-DD-infrastructure-setup.md`

## Available Deployment Documents

| Category | Document | Last Updated | Environment |
|----------|----------|-------------|------------|
| Infrastructure | [YYYY-MM-DD-infrastructure-architecture.md](./YYYY-MM-DD-infrastructure-architecture.md) | [Date] | All |
| Deployment | [YYYY-MM-DD-production-deployment.md](./YYYY-MM-DD-production-deployment.md) | [Date] | Production |
| CI/CD | [YYYY-MM-DD-ci-cd-pipeline.md](./YYYY-MM-DD-ci-cd-pipeline.md) | [Date] | All |
| Disaster Recovery | [YYYY-MM-DD-disaster-recovery.md](./YYYY-MM-DD-disaster-recovery.md) | [Date] | Production |

## Best Practices

When creating deployment documentation:

1. Include detailed architecture diagrams
2. Document all configuration parameters
3. Provide step-by-step deployment instructions
4. Include validation steps to verify successful deployment
5. Document rollback procedures
6. Keep environment-specific details separate
7. Include security considerations
8. Document performance optimization settings
9. Include monitoring and alerting setup

## Related Documentation

Deployment documentation often relates to:
- Solution Architecture Documents in the `solution-architecture/` directory
- Security Documentation in the `security-docs/` directory
- Operations Documentation in the `operations-docs/` directory
- DevOps Documentation in the `devops-docs/` directory

## Review Schedule

To ensure deployment documentation stays current:

- Infrastructure architecture: Review quarterly or when significant changes occur
- Deployment procedures: Update after each major release
- CI/CD pipeline: Review monthly or when pipeline changes
- Disaster recovery: Test and update quarterly
- Environment configurations: Review when configuration changes are made
