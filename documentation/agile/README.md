# Agile Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to the agile development process used in the CollectiveMind project, including sprint planning, ceremonies, and other agile artifacts.

## Purpose

Agile documentation serves to:

1. **Track Progress**: Document sprint planning, execution, and results
2. **Guide Ceremonies**: Provide structure for agile ceremonies
3. **Support Collaboration**: Enable team collaboration and transparency
4. **Maintain History**: Keep a record of decisions and outcomes
5. **Facilitate Improvement**: Support continuous improvement through retrospectives

## Directory Structure

The agile documentation is organized into the following subdirectories:

- **[ceremonies/](./ceremonies/)**: Documentation for agile ceremonies
  - **Sprint Planning**: Guidelines and templates for sprint planning
  - **Daily Standups**: Structure and best practices for daily standups
  - **Sprint Reviews**: Templates and guidelines for sprint reviews
  - **Retrospectives**: Formats and tools for conducting retrospectives
  - **Backlog Refinement**: Processes for refining the product backlog

- **[sprints/](./sprints/)**: Documentation for individual sprints
  - Each sprint has its own directory (e.g., `2025-02-28-sprint-1/`)
  - Sprint directories contain planning documents, reviews, and retrospectives

## Key Documents

### Ceremonies

- **Sprint Planning Guide**: Guidelines for conducting effective sprint planning
- **Daily Standup Template**: Structure and questions for daily standups
- **Sprint Review Template**: Format and agenda for sprint reviews
- **Retrospective Guide**: Methods and tools for conducting retrospectives

### Sprints

- **Sprint Planning Document**: Goals, capacity, and backlog for each sprint
- **Sprint Review Document**: Accomplishments, demos, and feedback from each sprint
- **Sprint Retrospective Document**: Reflections and action items from each sprint

## Agile Practices

The CollectiveMind project follows these agile practices:

1. **Sprint Duration**: 2-week sprints
2. **Ceremonies Schedule**:
   - Sprint Planning: First day of sprint, 2 hours
   - Daily Standups: Every day, 15 minutes
   - Backlog Refinement: Mid-sprint, 1 hour
   - Sprint Review: Last day of sprint, 1 hour
   - Sprint Retrospective: Last day of sprint, 1 hour
3. **Story Points**: Using Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
4. **Definition of Ready**: Criteria for stories to be considered ready for sprint planning
5. **Definition of Done**: Criteria for stories to be considered complete

## Best Practices

When creating agile documentation:

1. Keep documentation lightweight and focused on value
2. Update documentation regularly to reflect current practices
3. Use templates to ensure consistency across sprints
4. Document decisions and action items clearly
5. Include metrics to track progress and improvement
6. Make documentation accessible to all team members
7. Review and refine documentation practices regularly

## Related Documentation

Agile documentation often relates to:
- Project Management Documentation in the `project-management/` directory
- Product Requirements in the `product-requirements/` directory
- Process Documentation in the `process/` directory

## Review Schedule

To ensure agile documentation stays current:

- Sprint documentation: Review at the end of each sprint
- Ceremony templates: Review quarterly or when process changes
- Agile practices: Review semi-annually or when significant process changes occur
