# CollectiveMind Documentation

This directory contains all documentation for the CollectiveMind project, organized by functional areas and document types. This README provides an overview of the documentation structure, guidelines for contributing, and information on how to navigate the documentation effectively.

> **Note**: The documentation structure was reorganized on February 28, 2025 to improve organization and discoverability. If you're looking for documentation that you can't find, please refer to the directory structure below or contact the documentation team.

## Documentation Purpose and Design

This documentation structure is designed to provide comprehensive context and consistency for any agent (human or AI) seeking to understand, and then action change on, the CollectiveMind business. Key design principles include:

1. **Hierarchical Organization**: Documentation is organized in a logical hierarchy from strategic vision down to technical implementation details
2. **Cross-Referencing**: Related documents are linked to provide a complete picture across functional areas
3. **Standardized Formats**: Consistent document structures make information easy to locate
4. **Contextual Depth**: Each area provides both high-level overviews and detailed specifics
5. **Temporal Awareness**: Documentation includes historical context, current state, and future direction

### For Human Agents

For human team members, this documentation serves as:
- A single source of truth for project information
- An onboarding resource for new team members
- A reference for decision-making and implementation
- A knowledge base to understand project context and history

### For AI Agents

For AI assistants and tools, this documentation provides:
- Structured context to understand the business domain
- Clear guidelines for generating appropriate responses and solutions
- Reference material to ensure outputs align with project standards
- Historical context to inform recommendations and actions

### Integration with Cursor Rules

This documentation should be used in collaboration with Cursor rules, which provide specific guidance for AI agents on how to interact with the codebase. While the documentation provides comprehensive context, Cursor rules offer targeted instructions for specific tasks and code patterns.

Together, the documentation and Cursor rules create a complete framework that enables both human and AI agents to:
1. Understand the business context and objectives
2. Follow established patterns and practices
3. Make informed decisions aligned with project goals
4. Implement changes consistently and effectively

## Navigation Patterns for Agents

### Top-Down Navigation
Start with high-level strategy and work down to implementation details:
1. Begin with **Strategy** documentation to understand vision and goals
2. Move to **Product Requirements** to see how strategy translates to features
3. Explore **Technical** and **Design** documentation for implementation details

### Bottom-Up Navigation
Start with specific implementation and work up to understand context:
1. Begin with **Technical** or **Design** documentation for specific components
2. Move to **Product Requirements** to understand feature context
3. Explore **Strategy** documentation to understand business objectives

### Role-Based Navigation
Different roles may focus on different documentation areas:
- **Product Managers**: Strategy, Product Requirements, Market Research
- **Developers**: Technical, Product Requirements, Process
- **Designers**: Design, Product Requirements, User Research
- **Project Managers**: Project Management, Process, Agile

## Contributing to Documentation

### Documentation Standards

1. **File Naming**: Use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `user-authentication.md`)
2. **Directory Structure**: Place documents in the appropriate category directory
3. **Metadata**: Include metadata at the top of each document (title, author, date, status)
4. **Formatting**: Use Markdown for all documentation
5. **Images**: Store images in an `assets` folder within the relevant directory
6. **Links**: Use relative links to reference other documents

### Documentation Workflow

1. **Creation**: Create new documentation using the appropriate template
2. **Review**: Have documentation reviewed by relevant stakeholders
3. **Publication**: Merge approved documentation into the main branch
4. **Maintenance**: Regularly review and update documentation

## Tools and Utilities

### Roadmap Visualization

The product roadmap visualization tool is available in the `product-requirements/roadmap` directory. This tool generates interactive roadmaps from feature documentation.

To update the roadmap:

```bash
cd documentation/product-requirements/roadmap
npm run update
```

### Documentation Templates

Templates for various document types are available in the `process/templates` directory. Use these templates to ensure consistency across documentation.

## Documentation Best Practices

1. **Keep it Updated**: Regularly review and update documentation
2. **Be Concise**: Write clear, concise documentation that is easy to understand
3. **Use Examples**: Include examples and code snippets where appropriate
4. **Consider the Audience**: Write for the intended audience (developers, users, etc.)
5. **Link Related Documents**: Create connections between related documentation
6. **Version Control**: Use version control for documentation changes
7. **Include Context**: Provide context for why decisions were made
8. **Avoid Duplication**: Maintain a single source of truth for each type of documentation
9. **AI-Friendly Structure**: Organize content with clear headings and consistent patterns to facilitate AI comprehension
10. **Cursor Rule Integration**: Reference relevant Cursor rules in technical documentation to guide AI assistance
