# Wireframes Documentation

This directory contains wireframes for the CollectiveMind project. Wireframes are low-fidelity representations of user interfaces that outline the basic structure, layout, and functionality without focusing on visual design details.

## Purpose

The purpose of this documentation is to:

1. Document the structural layout of user interfaces
2. Provide a reference for the placement of UI elements
3. Illustrate user flows and interactions at a basic level
4. Serve as a foundation for higher-fidelity designs

## Directory Contents

The wireframes are organized by:

- **Feature**: Wireframes specific to individual features
- **Page Type**: Wireframes for common page types (e.g., dashboard, settings, profile)
- **User Flow**: Wireframes that illustrate specific user journeys
- **Version**: Wireframes organized by version or iteration

## Wireframe Standards

All wireframes in this directory follow these standards:

1. **Format**: Wireframes are created in Figma and exported as PNG/PDF
2. **Naming Convention**: `[feature]-[page]-[version].png`
3. **Annotations**: Key elements are annotated to explain functionality
4. **Versioning**: Wireframes are versioned to track changes

## Key Wireframes

- **Dashboard**: [Dashboard Wireframes](./dashboard/)
- **User Profile**: [User Profile Wireframes](./user-profile/)
- **Settings**: [Settings Wireframes](./settings/)
- **Authentication**: [Authentication Wireframes](./authentication/)
- **Feature-specific**: [Feature Wireframes](./features/)

- [Prototypes](../prototypes/): Interactive prototypes built from wireframes
- [User Flows](../user-flows/): User journey and flow diagrams

## Wireframe Creation Process

1. **Research**: Gather requirements and user needs
2. **Sketching**: Create initial sketches of the interface
3. **Wireframing**: Develop digital wireframes in Figma
4. **Review**: Review wireframes with stakeholders
5. **Iteration**: Refine wireframes based on feedback
6. **Documentation**: Document wireframes and add to this repository

## Tools

- **Primary Tool**: [Figma](https://figma.com)
- **Alternative Tools**: Adobe XD, Sketch, Balsamiq

## Contributing

When contributing wireframes:

1. Follow the wireframe standards outlined above
2. Use the [design contribution workflow](../../process/workflows/design-workflow.md)
3. Ensure wireframes are properly annotated
4. Include a brief description of the wireframe's purpose
