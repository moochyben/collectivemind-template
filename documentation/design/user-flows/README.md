# User Flows Documentation

This directory contains user flow diagrams for the CollectiveMind project. User flows are visual representations of the paths users take to complete tasks within the application, showing the sequence of screens and decision points.

## Purpose

The purpose of this documentation is to:

1. Visualize the journey users take through the application
2. Document the steps required to complete specific tasks
3. Identify potential pain points or areas for optimization
4. Provide a reference for designers and developers

## Directory Contents

The user flows are organized by:

- **Feature**: User flows specific to individual features
- **User Type**: User flows for different user personas or roles
- **Task**: User flows organized by specific tasks or goals
- **Version**: User flows organized by version or iteration

## User Flow Standards

All user flows in this directory follow these standards:

1. **Format**: User flows are created in Figma/Miro and exported as PNG/PDF
2. **Naming Convention**: `[feature]-[task]-[version].png`
3. **Notation**: Standard flowchart notation is used for consistency
4. **Detail Level**: Appropriate level of detail based on complexity

## Key User Flows

- **User Registration**: [Registration Flow](./registration/)
- **Authentication**: [Login and Authentication Flows](./authentication/)
- **Core Features**: [Feature-specific Flows](./features/)
- **Settings Management**: [Settings Flows](./settings/)

## User Flow Components

User flows typically include the following components:

1. **Starting Points**: Entry points into the flow
2. **Screens/Pages**: Representations of UI screens
3. **Decision Points**: Points where users make choices
4. **Actions**: User actions that trigger transitions
5. **Endpoints**: Successful completion or exit points
6. **Annotations**: Explanatory notes about specific steps

## User Flow Creation Process

1. **Task Analysis**: Identify the task and user goals
2. **Path Mapping**: Map out the possible paths to complete the task
3. **Screen Identification**: Identify screens needed in the flow
4. **Flow Creation**: Create the visual flow diagram
5. **Review**: Review the flow with stakeholders
6. **Iteration**: Refine the flow based on feedback
7. **Documentation**: Document the flow and add to this repository

## Tools

- **Primary Tools**: [Figma](https://figma.com), [Miro](https://miro.com)
- **Alternative Tools**: Lucidchart, Draw.io, OmniGraffle
