# Design Documentation

This directory contains design documentation for the CollectiveMind project, including both UX design assets and technical design documents.

## Purpose

Design documentation serves to:

1. **Define Visual Design**: Document the design system, components, and patterns
2. **Guide Implementation**: Provide guidelines for implementing consistent user interfaces
3. **Document Technical Design**: Outline technical implementation approaches for features
4. **Support Design Decisions**: Explain the rationale behind design decisions
5. **Ensure Consistency**: Maintain consistent user experience across the application
6. **Facilitate Collaboration**: Enable effective collaboration between designers and developers

## Directory Structure

The design documentation is organized into the following subdirectories:

- **[design-system/](./design-system/)**: Design system components and guidelines
  - Visual design guidelines (typography, colors, spacing)
  - Component specifications
  - Design tokens
  - Accessibility guidelines

- **[wireframes/](./wireframes/)**: Low-fidelity design wireframes
  - Screen layouts
  - Information architecture
  - Content structure

- **[prototypes/](./prototypes/)**: Interactive prototypes
  - High-fidelity mockups
  - Interactive flows
  - Animation specifications

- **[user-flows/](./user-flows/)**: User journey and flow diagrams
  - User journey maps
  - Task flows
  - Navigation maps

- **[technical-designs/](./technical-designs/)**: Technical design documents
  - Feature implementation designs
  - Architecture diagrams
  - Component design specifications

## Document Types

### UX Design Documents

- **Design System**: Documentation of the design system, including principles, components, and patterns
- **Style Guide**: Visual design guidelines, including typography, colors, and spacing
- **Component Library**: Detailed specifications for UI components
- **Interaction Patterns**: Standard interaction patterns and behaviors
- **User Research**: User research findings, personas, and journey maps
- **Wireframes**: Low-fidelity representations of user interfaces
- **Prototypes**: Interactive prototypes and mockups
- **Usability Testing**: Usability testing procedures and results
- **Accessibility Guidelines**: UX-specific accessibility guidelines

### Technical Design Documents

- **Feature Designs**: Technical implementation approach for features
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Visual representations of system architecture
- **Component Designs**: Technical specifications for components
- **Data Models**: Database schema and data structure designs
- **API Specifications**: Technical specifications for APIs
- **Algorithm Designs**: Detailed algorithm implementations

## Naming Convention

Design documentation should follow these naming conventions:

- UX design documents: `YYYY-MM-DD-ux-topic-name.md`
- Technical design documents: `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name-design.md`

## Best Practices

When creating design documentation:

1. Use visual examples to illustrate design concepts
2. Include both the "what" and the "why" of design decisions
3. Document component states (default, hover, active, disabled, etc.)
4. Include responsive behavior and adaptations
5. Document accessibility considerations for each component
6. Include architecture diagrams in technical designs
7. Document data models and API specifications where relevant
8. Consider performance, security, and scalability implications
9. Address potential failure modes and mitigations
10. Keep documentation in sync with the actual implementation

## Related Documentation

Design documentation often relates to:
- Product Requirements in the `product-requirements/` directory
- Technical Documentation in the `technical/` directory
- API Documentation in the `technical/apis/` directory

## Review Schedule

To ensure design documentation stays current:

- Design system: Review quarterly or when major design changes occur
- Component library: Update when components are added or modified
- Style guide: Review semi-annually or when brand guidelines change
- Technical designs: Review when implementation changes significantly
