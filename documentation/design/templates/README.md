# Design Documentation Templates

This directory contains templates for creating various types of design documentation for the CollectiveMind project. These templates ensure consistency and completeness across all design documentation.

## Purpose

The purpose of these templates is to:

1. Standardize the format and structure of design documentation
2. Ensure all necessary information is included in each document
3. Reduce the time required to create new documentation
4. Maintain consistency across the design documentation

## Available Templates

- Context and background
- The decision made
- Alternatives considered
- Decision rationale
- Implementation details
- Accessibility considerations
- Technical implications
- Follow-up actions

Use this template whenever making significant design decisions that should be documented for future reference.

### Technical Design Documentation Template

The [Technical Design Documentation Template](./technical-design-template.md) provides a structured format for documenting technical design specifications. It includes sections for:

- Component structure
- Technical specifications
- Component breakdown
- States and variations
- Behavior specifications
- Responsive behavior
- Data requirements
- Accessibility implementation
- Performance considerations
- Technical constraints
- Implementation approach
- Code examples
- Testing requirements

- Notes for developers

Use this template when creating technical design documentation to bridge the gap between visual designs and implementation.

### Design System Component Template

The [Design System Component Template](./design-system-component-template.md) provides a structured format for documenting components in the design system. It includes sections for:

- Visual examples
- Component variants and states
- Component anatomy
- Design specifications (dimensions, typography, color, spacing)
- Behavior and responsive design
- Accessibility considerations
- Code implementation and API
- Usage guidelines
- Related components
- Design decisions
- Version history

Use this template when documenting components in the design system to ensure comprehensive and consistent documentation.

## Using These Templates

To use these templates:

1. Copy the appropriate template file
2. Rename it according to the naming conventions in the respective directory's README
3. Fill in all sections of the template
4. Remove any instructional text in brackets
5. Add the completed document to the appropriate directory

## Contributing New Templates

To contribute a new template:

1. Identify a need for a new type of design documentation
2. Create a template that follows the general structure and format of existing templates
3. Include clear instructions within the template
4. Add the template to this directory
5. Update this README to include information about the new template

## Best Practices

When creating templates:

1. Be comprehensive but concise
2. Include clear instructions for each section
3. Use markdown formatting for consistency
4. Consider the needs of all potential users of the template
5. Ensure accessibility considerations are included
