# Technical Designs Documentation

This directory contains technical design documentation for the CollectiveMind project. Technical designs bridge the gap between visual designs and implementation, providing detailed specifications for developers.

## Purpose

The purpose of this documentation is to:

1. Translate visual designs into technical specifications
2. Document component behavior and interactions in detail
3. Provide implementation guidance for developers
4. Ensure consistency between design intent and implementation

## Directory Contents

The technical designs are organized by:

- **Feature**: Technical designs for specific features
- **Component**: Technical specifications for reusable components
- **Platform**: Designs specific to web, mobile, or other platforms
- **Version**: Designs organized by version or iteration

## Technical Design Standards

All technical designs in this directory follow these standards:

1. **Format**: Technical designs are created in Markdown with supporting diagrams
2. **Naming Convention**: `[feature]-[component]-technical-spec.md`
3. **Detail Level**: Comprehensive specifications including states, behaviors, and edge cases
4. **Diagrams**: UML or similar diagrams for complex interactions

## Key Technical Designs

- **Component Specifications**: [Component Technical Specs](./components/)
- **Feature Implementations**: [Feature Technical Specs](./features/)
- **Interaction Patterns**: [Interaction Technical Specs](./interactions/)
- **Responsive Behavior**: [Responsive Design Specs](./responsive/)

## Technical Design Components

Technical designs typically include the following components:

1. **Overview**: Brief description of the component or feature
2. **Visual Reference**: Links to wireframes or prototypes
3. **Component Structure**: Detailed breakdown of the component
4. **States and Variations**: All possible states and variations
5. **Behavior Specifications**: Detailed behavior descriptions
6. **Accessibility Requirements**: WCAG compliance specifications
7. **Technical Constraints**: Any technical limitations or requirements
8. **Implementation Notes**: Guidance for developers

- [Wireframes](../wireframes/): Visual references for the technical designs
- [Prototypes](../prototypes/): Interactive references for behavior
- [Architecture Documentation](../../technical/architecture/): System architecture documentation

## Technical Design Creation Process

1. **Design Review**: Review visual designs and prototypes
2. **Component Analysis**: Break down designs into components
3. **Specification Development**: Create detailed specifications
4. **Developer Consultation**: Consult with developers on feasibility
5. **Documentation**: Document the technical design
6. **Review**: Review with design and development teams
7. **Iteration**: Refine based on feedback

## Tools

- **Documentation**: Markdown, Confluence
- **Diagramming**: Draw.io, Lucidchart, Mermaid
- **Collaboration**: Figma, GitHub

## Contributing

When contributing technical designs:

1. Follow the technical design standards outlined above
2. Ensure specifications are clear and unambiguous
3. Include all necessary states and edge cases
4. Consult with both designers and developers
5. Follow the [documentation workflow](../../process/workflows/documentation-workflow.md)
