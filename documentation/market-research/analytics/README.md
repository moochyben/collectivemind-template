# Analytics Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to data analytics, business intelligence, and reporting capabilities of the project.

## Purpose

Analytics documentation serves to:

1. **Define Analytics Architecture**: Document the overall analytics architecture and components
2. **Guide Implementation**: Provide guidelines for implementing analytics solutions
3. **Document Data Models**: Describe data models used for analytics and reporting
4. **Support Decision Making**: Enable data-driven decision making through analytics
5. **Ensure Data Quality**: Document data quality standards and validation procedures
6. **Facilitate Insights**: Provide guidance for extracting insights from data

## Document Types

This directory includes several types of analytics documentation:

- **Analytics Architecture**: Overall architecture of the analytics system
- **Data Pipelines**: Documentation of ETL/ELT processes and data pipelines
- **Data Warehouse**: Structure and organization of the data warehouse
- **Data Models**: Dimensional models, fact tables, and dimension tables
- **Reporting Framework**: Documentation of reporting tools and frameworks
- **Dashboards**: Specifications for dashboards and visualizations
- **KPIs and Metrics**: Definitions of key performance indicators and metrics
- **Data Quality**: Procedures for ensuring data quality and integrity
- **Data Governance**: Policies for data access, security, and compliance
- **Advanced Analytics**: Documentation of machine learning models and predictive analytics

## Document Structure

Each analytics document should follow this general structure:

1. **Overview**: Brief description of the analytics component or process
2. **Purpose**: Why the component exists and what it accomplishes
3. **Architecture**: How the component fits into the overall analytics system
4. **Implementation Details**: Technical details of the implementation
5. **Data Sources**: Where the data comes from and how it's collected
6. **Data Transformations**: How the data is processed and transformed
7. **Data Models**: Structure and organization of the data
8. **Access and Security**: How access to the data is controlled
9. **Usage Guidelines**: How to use the analytics component
10. **Examples**: Examples of insights or reports that can be generated
11. **References**: Links to related documentation or resources

## Naming Convention

Analytics documentation should follow this naming convention:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-analytics-topic-name.md
```

For example: `YYYY-MM-DD-data-warehouse-schema.md` or `YYYY-MM-DD-executive-dashboard.md`

## Best Practices

When creating analytics documentation:

1. Clearly define business questions that analytics should answer
2. Document data lineage from source to reporting
3. Include data dictionary with clear definitions of fields
4. Document calculation methodologies for derived metrics
5. Include data refresh schedules and procedures
6. Document data access controls and security measures
7. Include examples of how to interpret reports and dashboards
8. Document data retention policies and archiving procedures
9. Include performance considerations for queries and reports
10. Document data quality checks and validation procedures

## Related Documentation

Analytics documentation often relates to:
- Data Architecture Documents in the `data-architecture/` directory
- Business Documentation in the `business-docs/` directory
- Integration Documentation in the `integration-docs/` directory
- Security Documentation in the `security-docs/` directory

## Review Schedule

To ensure analytics documentation stays current:

- Analytics architecture: Review quarterly or when architecture changes
- Data models: Update when data models change
- KPIs and metrics: Review quarterly or when business requirements change
- Dashboards: Update when dashboards are modified
- Data quality procedures: Review semi-annually
