# Security Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to the security aspects of the project, including security architecture, policies, procedures, and compliance requirements.

## Purpose

Security documentation serves to:

1. **Define Security Architecture**: Document the security components and controls
2. **Guide Implementation**: Provide guidelines for secure development and deployment
3. **Ensure Compliance**: Document adherence to regulatory and industry standards
4. **Support Audits**: Provide evidence for security audits and assessments
5. **Manage Risks**: Document security risks and mitigation strategies
6. **Respond to Incidents**: Outline procedures for security incident response

## Document Types

This directory includes several types of security documentation:

- **Security Architecture**: Diagrams and descriptions of security components and controls
- **Security Policies**: Organizational security policies and standards
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Implementation of identity and access management
- **Data Protection**: Strategies for protecting data at rest and in transit
- **Secure Development**: Guidelines for secure coding and development practices
- **Vulnerability Management**: Procedures for identifying and addressing vulnerabilities
- **Compliance Documentation**: Evidence of compliance with regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- **Security Testing**: Methodologies for security testing and penetration testing
- **Incident Response**: Procedures for responding to security incidents
- **Risk Assessment**: Documentation of security risks and mitigation strategies

## Document Structure

Each security document should follow this general structure:

1. **Overview**: Brief description of the security aspect being documented
2. **Scope**: What systems, data, or processes are covered
3. **Roles and Responsibilities**: Who is responsible for implementation and maintenance
4. **Detailed Content**: Comprehensive information on the specific security topic
5. **Implementation Guidelines**: How to implement the security controls
6. **Verification**: How to verify that controls are working as expected
7. **References**: Links to related documentation, standards, or regulations

## Naming Convention

Security documentation should follow this naming convention:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-security-topic-name.md
```

For example: `YYYY-MM-DD-authentication-implementation.md` or `YYYY-MM-DD-data-encryption.md`

## Available Security Documents

| Category | Document | Last Updated | Status |
|----------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Architecture | [YYYY-MM-DD-security-architecture.md](./YYYY-MM-DD-security-architecture.md) | [Date] | [Status] |
| Authentication | [YYYY-MM-DD-authentication-implementation.md](./YYYY-MM-DD-authentication-implementation.md) | [Date] | [Status] |
| Data Protection | [YYYY-MM-DD-data-encryption.md](./YYYY-MM-DD-data-encryption.md) | [Date] | [Status] |
| Incident Response | [YYYY-MM-DD-incident-response-plan.md](./YYYY-MM-DD-incident-response-plan.md) | [Date] | [Status] |

## Best Practices

When creating security documentation:

1. Keep sensitive details separate and properly secured
2. Use clear, precise language to avoid misinterpretation
3. Include diagrams to illustrate security architecture
4. Document both technical and procedural controls
5. Reference industry standards and best practices
6. Include validation and testing procedures
7. Document security assumptions and limitations
8. Keep documentation up to date with evolving threats
9. Include contact information for security personnel

## Related Documentation

Security documentation often relates to:
- Solution Architecture Documents in the `solution-architecture/` directory
- Deployment Documentation in the `deployment-docs/` directory
- Operations Documentation in the `operations-docs/` directory
- Compliance Documentation in the `business-docs/` directory

## Review Schedule

To ensure security documentation stays current:

- Security architecture: Review quarterly or when significant changes occur
- Security policies: Review annually or when regulatory requirements change
- Authentication implementation: Review semi-annually or after major changes
- Vulnerability management: Update monthly with new vulnerability information
- Incident response plan: Test and update quarterly
- Compliance documentation: Review according to regulatory requirements
