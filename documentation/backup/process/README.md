1. **Clarity**: Processes should be clearly documented and easy to understand
2. **Consistency**: Processes should be consistent across the organization
3. **Practicality**: Processes should be practical and aligned with actual work practices
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Processes should be regularly reviewed and improved
5. **Accessibility**: Process documentation should be accessible to all team members
