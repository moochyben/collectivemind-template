# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains architecture documentation for the CollectiveMind project, including system design, data architecture, and solution architecture.

## Purpose

Architecture documentation serves to:

1. **Define Structure**: Document the structure and components of the system
2. **Guide Development**: Provide architectural guidance for development
3. **Support Decision Making**: Document architectural decisions and rationales
4. **Facilitate Understanding**: Help stakeholders understand the system architecture
5. **Enable Maintenance**: Support system maintenance and evolution
6. **Ensure Consistency**: Maintain consistent architectural patterns

## Directory Structure

The architecture documentation is organized into the following subdirectories:

- **[data-architecture/](./data-architecture/)**: Database and data flow documentation
  - Data models
  - Database schemas
  - Data flows
  - Data storage strategies
  - Data migration plans

- **[solution-architecture/](./solution-architecture/)**: Detailed solution architecture documents
  - Component diagrams
  - Sequence diagrams
  - Deployment diagrams
  - Integration patterns
  - Architectural patterns

## Key Documents

### System Architecture

- **System Architecture Overview**: High-level overview of the system architecture
- **Component Architecture**: Detailed documentation of system components
- **Technology Stack**: Documentation of the technology stack
- **Architecture Principles**: Guiding principles for architectural decisions
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**: Records of architectural decisions

### Data Architecture

- **Data Model**: Documentation of the data model
- **Database Schema**: Documentation of the database schema
- **Data Flow Diagrams**: Diagrams showing data flow through the system
- **Data Storage Strategy**: Strategy for data storage and management
- **Data Migration Plan**: Plan for data migrations

### Solution Architecture

- **Component Diagrams**: Diagrams showing system components and their relationships
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Diagrams showing interactions between components
- **Deployment Architecture**: Documentation of the deployment architecture
- **Integration Architecture**: Documentation of integration with external systems
- **Security Architecture**: Documentation of security architecture

## Architectural Patterns

CollectiveMind follows these architectural patterns:

1. **Microservices Architecture**: System is composed of loosely coupled services
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Components communicate through events
3. **API-First Design**: APIs are designed before implementation
4. **Domain-Driven Design**: System is organized around business domains
5. **CQRS Pattern**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation for data operations
6. **Hexagonal Architecture**: Core business logic is isolated from external concerns

## Best Practices

When creating architecture documentation:

1. Keep documentation aligned with the actual implementation
2. Use standard notation (UML, C4 model) for diagrams
3. Document architectural decisions and their rationales
4. Include both high-level and detailed views of the architecture
5. Update documentation when architecture changes
6. Make architecture documentation accessible to all stakeholders
7. Include non-functional requirements and how they are addressed
8. Document trade-offs and constraints that influenced the architecture

## Related Documentation

Architecture documentation often relates to:
- Technical Documentation in the `technical/` directory
- API Documentation in the `api-docs/` directory
- DevOps Documentation in the `devops-docs/` directory
- Security Documentation in the `security-docs/` directory

## Review Schedule

To ensure architecture documentation stays current:

- System architecture: Review quarterly or when significant changes occur
- Component architecture: Update when components change
- Data architecture: Update when data model changes
- Solution architecture: Review semi-annually or when major changes occur
- Architectural patterns: Review annually or when patterns change
