## Purpose

Architecture documentation serves to:

1. **Define Structure**: Document the structure and components of the system
2. **Guide Development**: Provide architectural guidance for development
3. **Support Decision Making**: Document architectural decisions and rationales
4. **Facilitate Understanding**: Help stakeholders understand the system architecture
5. **Enable Maintenance**: Support system maintenance and evolution
6. **Ensure Consistency**: Maintain consistent architectural patterns

## Directory Structure

> **Note**: The following directories are planned and will be populated as part of our documentation improvement initiative.

The architecture documentation is organized into the following directories:

- **[system/](./system/)** *(Planned)*: System architecture documentation
- **[data-architecture/](./data-architecture/)** *(Planned)*: Data architecture documentation
- **[solution-architecture/](./solution-architecture/)** *(Planned)*: Solution architecture documentation
- **[patterns/](./patterns/)** *(Planned)*: Architectural patterns documentation
- **[decisions/](./decisions/)** *(Planned)*: Architecture decision records
- **[diagrams/](./diagrams/)** *(Planned)*: Architecture diagrams and models

## Architecture Standards

CollectiveMind follows these architectural standards:

1. **Microservices**: Loosely coupled service architecture
2. **Event-Driven**: Event-based communication
3. **API-First**: API-driven development
4. **Domain-Driven**: Business domain organization
5. **CQRS**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation
6. **Hexagonal**: Isolated business logic
7. **Cloud-Native**: Cloud-optimized design

## Documentation Structure

Each architecture document includes:

1. **Overview**: Architecture purpose and scope
2. **Design**: Architectural design decisions
3. **Components**: Component descriptions
4. **Interactions**: Component interactions
5. **Technologies**: Technology choices
6. **Security**: Security considerations
7. **Scalability**: Scaling approach
8. **References**: Related documentation

## Best Practices

When implementing architecture:

1. Follow established patterns
2. Document design decisions
3. Consider scalability
4. Implement security by design
5. Maintain loose coupling
6. Enable monitoring
7. Plan for evolution
8. Use standard notations
9. Consider performance
10. Document trade-offs

## Tools and Resources

> **Note**: The following tools and resources are planned and will be created as part of our documentation improvement initiative.

- **[Architecture Templates](./templates/)** *(Planned)*: Documentation templates
- **[Diagram Templates](./diagrams/templates/)** *(Planned)*: Standard diagrams
- **[Decision Templates](./decisions/templates/)** *(Planned)*: ADR templates
- **[Pattern Library](./patterns/library/)** *(Planned)*: Pattern catalog

## Related Documentation

Architecture documentation relates to:
- [Technical Documentation](../): Technical overview
- [API Documentation](../apis/): API specifications
- [DevOps Documentation](../devops/): DevOps processes
- [Security Documentation](../security/): Security architecture
- [Infrastructure Documentation](../infrastructure/): Infrastructure design

## Review Schedule

To ensure architecture documentation stays current:

- System Architecture: Review quarterly
- Data Architecture: Review monthly
- Solution Architecture: Review quarterly
- Patterns & Standards: Review semi-annually
- Security Architecture: Review monthly
- ADRs: Review with changes
