# Data Architecture Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to the data architecture of the project, including database schemas, data models, and entity relationships.

## Contents

> **Note**: The following documents are planned and will be created as part of our documentation improvement initiative.

- **[Database Schema Documentation]** *(Planned)*: Comprehensive database schema documentation
- **[Entity Relationship Diagrams]** *(Planned)*: Visual representations of data relationships
- **[Data Model Specifications]** *(Planned)*: Detailed data model documentation
- **[Field Definitions]** *(Planned)*: Field definitions and data types
- **[Database Optimization]** *(Planned)*: Database optimization strategies
- **[Data Access Patterns]** *(Planned)*: Common data access patterns
- **[Data Migration Guidelines]** *(Planned)*: Guidelines for data migrations

## Purpose

The data architecture documentation serves to:

1. **Document Data Structures**: Capture the current data models and relationships
2. **Guide Implementation**: Provide clear guidelines for database schema development
3. **Ensure Consistency**: Promote consistent data handling across the application
4. **Support Optimization**: Document indexing and query optimization strategies
5. **Enable Evolution**: Facilitate controlled schema evolution and migrations

## Data Architecture Components

This directory includes documentation for several aspects of data architecture:

> **Note**: The following components are planned and will be documented as part of our documentation improvement initiative.

- **[Logical Data Models]** *(Planned)*: Entity definitions and relationships independent of implementation
- **[Physical Data Models]** *(Planned)*: Implementation-specific database schemas
- **[Data Dictionary]** *(Planned)*: Comprehensive listing of all data elements and their attributes
- **[Access Patterns]** *(Planned)*: Common data access patterns and their implementation
- **[Performance Considerations]** *(Planned)*: Indexing strategies and query optimization
- **[Data Governance]** *(Planned)*: Guidelines for data quality, security, and compliance

## Using This Documentation

When implementing or modifying database schemas:

1. Review the entity relationship diagrams to understand data connections
2. Follow the field naming conventions and data types
3. Implement the recommended indexes for performance
4. Consider the documented access patterns when designing queries
5. Follow data migration guidelines when evolving the schema
6. Update this documentation when making significant changes to the data model

## Best Practices

When working with the data architecture:

1. Maintain referential integrity between related entities
2. Use consistent naming conventions for tables, fields, and indexes
3. Document all fields with clear descriptions and data types
4. Consider query performance when designing schemas
5. Implement appropriate indexing strategies
6. Plan for data growth and scalability
7. Follow established patterns for handling common data scenarios

- [Technical Architecture](../../): Technical documentation overview
- [API Documentation](../../apis/): API specifications and documentation
- [DevOps Documentation](../../devops/): Database deployment and operations
- [Security Documentation](../../security/): Data security and compliance

## Review Schedule

To ensure data architecture documentation stays current:

- Data Models: Update when data structures change
- Access Patterns: Review quarterly or when patterns change
- Performance Guidelines: Review semi-annually or when issues arise
- Migration Guidelines: Update with each schema migration
