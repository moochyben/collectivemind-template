# Integrations Documentation

This directory contains documentation related to integrations between CollectiveMind and external systems, tools, and services. The purpose of this documentation is to provide clear guidance on how these integrations work, how to set them up, and how to troubleshoot common issues.

## Directory Structure

The integrations documentation is organized into subdirectories for each integration:

- **[confluence/](./confluence/)**: Documentation for Confluence integration and sync
- **[api/](./api/)**: Documentation for external API integrations
- **[auth/](./auth/)**: Documentation for authentication integrations
- **[analytics/](./analytics/)**: Documentation for analytics integrations
- **[notification/](./notification/)**: Documentation for notification integrations

## Key Documents

2. **Maintainability**: Integration documentation must be kept up-to-date with changes to external systems
3. **Completeness**: Integration documentation must cover setup, usage, and troubleshooting
4. **Versioning**: Integration documentation must specify version compatibility
