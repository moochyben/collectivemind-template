# Reference Materials

This directory contains reference materials that influenced the design and requirements of the application. These materials provide context for understanding the industry standards, best practices, and external constraints that shaped the application.

## Purpose

Reference materials serve to:

1. **Preserve Context**: Maintain the original context and requirements that influenced the application design
2. **Inform Development**: Provide developers with industry-standard references
3. **Guide Decisions**: Help inform future decisions by understanding the original requirements
4. **Support Onboarding**: Help new team members understand the application's foundations
5. **Enable Traceability**: Allow tracing of features back to industry requirements

## Directory Structure

- **templates/**: Industry-standard templates that influenced data models and features
- **standards/**: Industry standards and best practices documents
- **research/**: Market research and competitive analysis
- **legacy/**: Documentation of legacy systems that were replaced or integrated with

## Available Reference Materials

| Category | Document | Description | Last Updated |
|----------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Templates | [template-name.md](./templates/template-name.md) | Description of the template | [Date] |
| Standards | [standard-name.md](./standards/standard-name.md) | Description of the standard | [Date] |
| Research | [research-topic.md](./research/research-topic.md) | Description of the research | [Date] |

## Using Reference Materials

When working with reference materials:

1. **Understand the Context**: Use these materials to understand why certain design decisions were made
2. **Identify Gaps**: Compare current implementation with industry standards to identify gaps
3. **Inform Improvements**: Use these materials to guide improvements while maintaining compatibility
4. **Document Deviations**: When deviating from industry standards, document the reasons why

## Contributing

When adding new reference materials:

1. Place them in the appropriate subdirectory
2. Use clear, descriptive filenames
3. Include metadata such as source, date, and version
4. Update this README if adding new categories
5. Document how the reference material influenced the application
