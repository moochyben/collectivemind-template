# Product Requirements Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) for the system. These documents serve as the definitive source of truth for feature specifications, acceptance criteria, and implementation status.

## Purpose

The PRDs in this directory aim to:

1. Document the complete requirements for each feature
2. Provide clear acceptance criteria for implementation
3. Track the current implementation status of features
4. Identify gaps between requirements and implementation
5. Prioritize future development efforts
6. Serve as a reference for product managers, developers, and stakeholders

## Document Structure

Each PRD follows a consistent structure to ensure comprehensive coverage of all aspects of a feature:

1. **Overview**: High-level description of the feature
2. **Background**: Context and rationale for the feature
3. **Goals and Success Metrics**: Objectives and measurable outcomes
4. **User Stories and Acceptance Criteria**: Detailed user needs and verification points
5. **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional specifications
6. **Data Model**: Entity definitions with field specifications
7. **User Experience**: Workflow descriptions and mockup references
8. **Technical Considerations**: Implementation notes and integration points
9. **Acceptance Criteria Tracking**: Current implementation status
10. **Gap Analysis**: Identification of missing functionality
11. **Implementation Recommendations**: Prioritized development roadmap
12. **Analysis Methodology**: Approach used to develop the PRD
13. **Tracking System**: Implementation completeness and priority matrices
14. **Timeline**: Estimated development schedule
15. **Open Questions**: Unresolved issues requiring decisions
16. **Appendix**: Reference materials and additional information

## Available PRDs

### System-Level PRD

The top-level system PRD provides a comprehensive overview of the entire platform, including system goals, user journeys, architecture, and implementation roadmap:

- [System PRD](./YYYY-MM-DD-system-prd.md) - Complete system overview and roadmap

### Feature-Level PRDs

Individual feature PRDs provide detailed specifications for each component of the system:

| Feature | Document | Last Updated | Status |
|---------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Feature 1 | [YYYY-MM-DD-feature-1.md](./YYYY-MM-DD-feature-1.md) | [Date] | [Status] |
| Feature 2 | [YYYY-MM-DD-feature-2.md](./YYYY-MM-DD-feature-2.md) | [Date] | [Status] |
| Feature 3 | [YYYY-MM-DD-feature-3.md](./YYYY-MM-DD-feature-3.md) | [Date] | [Status] |

## Feature Implementation Status Summary

| Feature | Implementation Status | Critical Gaps | Priority |
|---------|----------------------|---------------|----------|
| Feature 1 | [Status] | [Gaps] | [Priority] |
| Feature 2 | [Status] | [Gaps] | [Priority] |
| Feature 3 | [Status] | [Gaps] | [Priority] |

## Using These Documents

### For Product Managers
- Use these PRDs to track feature completeness and plan development sprints
- Reference acceptance criteria when validating implemented features
- Update implementation status as features are developed
- Use gap analysis to prioritize future development efforts

### For Developers
- Reference requirements and data models during implementation
- Use acceptance criteria to guide feature development
- Update code references in the tracking tables as features are implemented
- Consult technical considerations for implementation guidance

### For Stakeholders
- Review PRDs to understand feature capabilities and limitations
- Reference implementation status to understand current system capabilities
- Use timeline estimates for planning and resource allocation
- Provide input on open questions to guide feature development

## Maintenance Guidelines

To maintain the accuracy and usefulness of these PRDs:

1. Update implementation status as features are developed
2. Add code references to tracking tables when implementing features
3. Revise requirements as needed based on user feedback and business needs
4. Document any deviations from original requirements with rationale
5. Update data models as database schema evolves
6. Review and update PRDs at least quarterly to ensure accuracy

## Contributing

When creating or updating PRDs:

1. Follow the established document structure
2. Be specific and detailed in requirements and acceptance criteria
3. Include measurable success metrics
4. Document both functional and non-functional requirements
5. Provide comprehensive data models with field specifications
6. Include gap analysis and implementation recommendations
7. Update the README.md table when adding new PRDs
