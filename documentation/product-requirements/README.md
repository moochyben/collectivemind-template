# Product Requirements Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive Product Requirement Documents (PRDs) for the CollectiveMind project. These documents serve as the definitive source of truth for feature specifications, acceptance criteria, and implementation status.

## Purpose

The PRDs in this directory aim to:

1. Document the complete requirements for each feature
2. Provide clear acceptance criteria for implementation
3. Track the current implementation status of features
4. Identify gaps between requirements and implementation
5. Prioritize future development efforts
6. Serve as a reference for product managers, developers, and stakeholders

## Directory Structure

The product requirements documentation is organized into the following subdirectories:

- **[Features](./features/)**: Detailed documentation for individual features
  - **[2025-02-28-pomodoro-affirmation](./features/2025-02-28-pomodoro-affirmation/)**: Documentation for the Pomodoro Affirmation feature
  - **[2023-07-15-mood-capture](./features/2023-07-15-mood-capture/)**: Documentation for the Mood Capture feature
- **[Roadmap](./roadmap/)**: Product roadmap visualization and planning tools
  - Interactive timeline visualization
  - Feature summary reports
  - Guidelines for product and project managers
- **[Templates](./templates/)**: Templates for creating new feature documentation
  - Feature request templates
  - PRD templates
  - User story templates

## Document Structure

Each PRD follows a consistent structure to ensure comprehensive coverage of all aspects of a feature:

1. **Overview**: High-level description of the feature
2. **Background**: Context and rationale for the feature
3. **Goals and Success Metrics**: Objectives and measurable outcomes
4. **User Stories and Acceptance Criteria**: Detailed user needs and verification points
5. **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional specifications
6. **Data Model**: Entity definitions with field specifications
7. **User Experience**: Workflow descriptions and mockup references
8. **Technical Considerations**: Implementation notes and integration points
9. **Acceptance Criteria Tracking**: Current implementation status
10. **Gap Analysis**: Identification of missing functionality
11. **Implementation Recommendations**: Prioritized development roadmap
12. **Analysis Methodology**: Approach used to develop the PRD
13. **Tracking System**: Implementation completeness and priority matrices
14. **Timeline**: Estimated development schedule
15. **Open Questions**: Unresolved issues requiring decisions
16. **Appendix**: Reference materials and additional information

## Available Features

The following features are currently documented in this directory:

| Feature | Document | Last Updated | Status |
|---------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Pomodoro Affirmation | [2025-02-28-pomodoro-affirmation](./features/2025-02-28-pomodoro-affirmation/) | 2025-02-28 | In Development |

## Roadmap Tools

The roadmap directory contains tools for visualizing and managing the product roadmap:

- **[Roadmap Visualizer](./roadmap/RoadmapVisualizer.tsx)**: Interactive timeline visualization component
- **[Feature Summary](./roadmap/feature-summary.md)**: Comprehensive list of features grouped by category
- **[Product Manager Guidelines](./roadmap/product-manager-guidelines.md)**: Guidelines for product managers
- **[Project Manager Guidelines](./roadmap/project-manager-guidelines.md)**: Guidelines for project managers
- **[Update Scripts](./roadmap/update-roadmap.js)**: Scripts for updating the roadmap based on documentation

## Templates

The templates directory contains standardized templates for creating new product documentation:

- **[Feature Request Template](./templates/feature-request-template.md)**: Template for submitting new feature requests

## Using These Documents

### For Product Managers
- Use these PRDs to track feature completeness and plan development sprints
- Reference acceptance criteria when validating implemented features
- Update implementation status as features are developed
- Use gap analysis to prioritize future development efforts
- Utilize the roadmap tools to visualize and communicate the product timeline

### For Developers
- Reference requirements and data models during implementation
- Use acceptance criteria to guide feature development
- Update code references in the tracking tables as features are implemented
- Consult technical considerations for implementation guidance

### For Stakeholders
- Review PRDs to understand feature capabilities and limitations
- Reference implementation status to understand current system capabilities
- Use timeline estimates for planning and resource allocation
- Provide input on open questions to guide feature development
- View the roadmap visualization for a high-level overview of the product plan

## Maintenance Guidelines

To maintain the accuracy and usefulness of these PRDs:

1. Update implementation status as features are developed
2. Add code references to tracking tables when implementing features
3. Revise requirements as needed based on user feedback and business needs
4. Document any deviations from original requirements with rationale
5. Update data models as database schema evolves
6. Review and update PRDs at least quarterly to ensure accuracy
7. Keep the roadmap visualization up to date with the latest feature timelines
8. Use the provided templates when creating new feature documentation
