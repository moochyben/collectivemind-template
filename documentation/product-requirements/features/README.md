# Feature Documentation

This directory contains detailed documentation for individual features of the CollectiveMind project. Each feature is documented in its own subdirectory, providing comprehensive information about requirements, design, implementation, and testing.

## Purpose

The purpose of this documentation is to:

1. Define the requirements and specifications for each feature
2. Provide a single source of truth for feature information
3. Track the evolution of features over time
4. Facilitate communication between product, design, and development teams
5. Ensure consistent implementation of features across the project
6. Support maintenance and future enhancements
7. Enable efficient implementation using Cursor AI capabilities

## Feature Documentation Process

Features follow a standardized documentation and implementation process:

1. **Feature Evaluation**: Evaluate if the feature idea relates to existing features
2. **Feature Conception**: Document initial feature idea using the Feature Request template
3. **Documentation Creation**: Create comprehensive feature documentation using templates
4. **Documentation Review**: Review and approve documentation with stakeholders
5. **Visual-to-Code Translation**: Use Cursor to translate visual designs to code
6. **Implementation**: Develop the feature based on documentation and Cursor-generated code
7. **Verification**: Verify implementation against documentation

## Directory Structure

Features are organized in subdirectories using the following naming convention:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name
```

Where:
- `YYYY-MM-DD` is the date the feature was initiated (always use the current date, never placeholder dates)
- `feature-name` is a kebab-case name of the feature

For example:
- `2025-10-15-collaborative-editing`
- `2025-11-20-real-time-notifications`

## Feature Documentation Structure

Each feature directory should contain the following documentation:

### 1. Feature Request (`feature-request.md`)
- Problem statement
- User needs and pain points
- Business objectives
- Success metrics
- Stakeholders

### 2. Product Requirements Document (`PRD.md`)
- Feature overview
- User stories
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- User flows
- Constraints and limitations
- Dependencies
- Acceptance criteria
- Prioritization

### 3. Technical Specification (`technical-specification.md`)
- Architecture overview
- Data models
- API endpoints
- Integration points
- Security considerations
- Performance requirements
- Scalability considerations
- Technical dependencies
- **Cursor Implementation Directions** (required)

### 4. UI/UX Design (`ui-ux-design.md`)
- User interface mockups
- User experience flows
- Design system components
- Accessibility considerations
- Responsive design specifications
- Animation and interaction details
- **Cursor Implementation Directions** (required)

### 5. Implementation Plan (`implementation-plan.md`)
- Development approach
- Task breakdown
- Estimated effort
- Timeline
- Resource requirements
- Risk assessment
- Rollout strategy
- **Cursor Implementation Directions** (required)

### 6. Test Plan (`test-plan.md`)
- Test strategy
- Test cases
- Test data requirements
- Testing environments
- Automation approach
- Performance testing
- Security testing
- Acceptance testing

### 7. Supporting Directories
- `visual-references/`: Screenshots, mockups, and other visual assets
- `implementation/`: Code samples, prototypes, or implementation notes
- `cursor-integration/`: Specific guidance for Cursor AI integration

## Cursor Implementation Directions

Each technical document (Technical Specification, UI/UX Design, Implementation Plan) must include a "Cursor Implementation Directions" section that provides specific guidance for using Cursor AI to implement the feature. This section includes:

- **Code Structure**: File paths and organization for implementation
- **Implementation Order**: Step-by-step guidance for Cursor to follow
- **Key Functions/Components**: Essential elements to implement with descriptions
- **Testing Approach**: How to test the implementation
- **Related Cursor Rules**: Specific rules to reference during implementation

## Feature Lifecycle

Features go through the following lifecycle stages:

1. **Proposed**: Initial feature idea proposed and captured in a feature request
2. **Specified**: Feature requirements and specifications defined in the PRD
3. **Designed**: UI/UX design and technical specifications completed
4. **Planned**: Implementation plan and test plan created
5. **Implemented**: Feature implemented in code according to specifications
6. **Tested**: Feature tested against acceptance criteria and test plan
7. **Released**: Feature released to users with appropriate documentation
8. **Maintained**: Feature maintained and improved based on user feedback

## Creating a New Feature

To create documentation for a new feature:

1. Create a new directory using the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name` (use the current date)
2. Copy the template files from `documentation/product-requirements/templates/feature-template/`
3. Fill in each document with the appropriate information
4. Ensure all technical documents include the required "Cursor Implementation Directions" section
5. Get reviews from relevant stakeholders (product, design, engineering)
6. Update documentation as the feature evolves

## Best Practices

When documenting features:

1. **Be specific**: Provide concrete details rather than vague descriptions
2. **Use examples**: Include examples to illustrate requirements and behaviors
3. **Consider edge cases**: Document how the feature should handle exceptional situations
4. **Link related documents**: Reference related features, technical docs, or external resources
5. **Include visuals**: Use diagrams, mockups, and screenshots to clarify concepts
6. **Update regularly**: Keep documentation in sync with the actual implementation
7. **Version control**: Track major changes to feature specifications
8. **Seek feedback**: Get input from all stakeholders to ensure completeness
9. **Provide clear Cursor directions**: Ensure Cursor Implementation Directions are comprehensive
10. **Reference Cursor rules**: Identify and reference relevant rules in the `.cursor/rules/` directory
