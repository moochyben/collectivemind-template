# Feature Documentation

This directory contains detailed documentation for individual features of the CollectiveMind project. Each feature is documented in its own subdirectory, providing comprehensive information about requirements, design, implementation, and testing.

## Purpose

The purpose of this documentation is to:

1. Define the requirements and specifications for each feature
2. Provide a single source of truth for feature information
3. Track the evolution of features over time
4. Facilitate communication between product, design, and development teams

## Directory Structure

Features are organized in subdirectories using the following naming convention:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name
```

Where:
- `YYYY-MM-DD` is the date the feature was initiated
- `feature-name` is a kebab-case name of the feature

For example:
- `2023-07-15-mood-capture`
- `2025-02-28-pomodoro-affirmation`

## Feature Documentation Structure

Each feature directory contains the following documentation:

1. **Feature Specification**: Detailed requirements and specifications
2. **Design Documentation**: UI/UX design documentation
3. **Technical Design**: Technical implementation details
4. **Test Plan**: Test cases and acceptance criteria
5. **Release Notes**: Information for release announcements
